                  For 250 years (1565–1815), the Manila Galleon transported
                  Asian goods from the Philippines to the Americas under the
                  rule of the Spanish Crown. Stopping in Acapulco, Mexico, the
                  silk, fans, lacquered goods, clothes, and porcelain brought by
                  the galleon rapidly circulated through the Americas,
                  introducing a new visual culture that influenced objects,
                  consumers, makers, and merchants alike. Conversely, products
                  imported from the Americas, such as silver, indigo dye,
                  cochineal red, chili peppers, and corn, had an enormous impact
                  on Asia. Eleven scholars from the United States, Mexico, and
                  Singapore present current research on how the vast exchange of
                  materials, techniques, and ideas between continents impacted
                  the trajectory of art and material culture across the Pacific.

                  The Denver Art Museum boasts the largest and most
                  comprehensive collection of colonial Latin American art in the
                  United States and since 1968 has presented numerous
                  exhibitions, catalogs, and symposia that have deepened the
                  knowledge and broadened the scholarship in this area. However,
                  no art is made in a vacuum, and styles, techniques, and
                  materials from around the world influence local practices. For
                  instance, our broader collection includes Puebla pottery that
                  imitates Chinese blue-and-white porcelain, Mexican paintings
                  glinting with the iridescence of inlaid nacre that were
                  inspired by Asian lacquerware, and Asian ivories that depict a
                  curly-haired Christ Child or wounded Saint Sebastian.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For centuries, oceans provided the most significant means of
                  transmitting art and ideas around the globe. The establishment
                  of the Manila Galleon trade between New Spain and the
                  Philippines in the sixteenth century provided an annual
                  passage of art and ideas between the Americas and Asia. With
                  objects from China, Japan, and India readily accessible to
                  consumers in the viceroyalties and in Spain, local artists in
                  Manila, Mexico, Lima, and elsewhere began to imitate and
                  incorporate aspects of the new Asian luxury goods into their
                  own practices.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Despite the profound impact of Asia on colonial Latin America,
                  the subject has received relatively less attention than
                  comparable cross-cultural narratives. The Denver Art Museum
                  has pioneered this research and brought it to the fore on
                  numerous occasions as the field has expanded to include the
                  impact of the galleon trade on cultures at both ends of the
                  route. Through the efforts of the Mayer Center for Ancient and
                  Latin American Art, we are delighted to do so once again,
                  bringing together scholars to interrogate this vital moment of
                  cultural crosspollination. In November 2024, scholars from the
                  United States, Mexico, and Singapore converged for two days to
                  examine how the exchanges of materials, techniques, and ideas
                  across the Pacific Ocean impacted the trajectory of art in
                  both Latin America and Asia. The papers here result from the
                  engaging conversations held at the Denver Art Museum in the
                  midst of an early November snowstorm.
                </p>

                  I wish to express my gratitude to Karina H. Corrigan, Deputy
                  Chief Curator and the H. A. Crosby Forbes Curator of Asian
                  Export Art at the Peabody Essex Museum, and to Jorge Rivas
                  Pérez, former Frederick and Jan Mayer Curator of Latin
                  American Art at the Denver Art Museum and current Emily Rauh
                  Pulitzer Deputy Director and Chief Curator at the Saint Louis
                  Art Museum, for their dedication to organizing the 2024
                  symposium. My thanks also go to Kathryn Santner, Assistant
                  Curator of Latin American Art at the Denver Art Museum, who
                  tirelessly led the editorial efforts for these proceedings.
                  And I gratefully acknowledge Jan Mayer, whose ongoing support
                  for the museum and the Mayer Center, along with that of her
                  late husband, Frederick Mayer, has been so crucial to the
                  advancement of the study of the arts of ancient and colonial
                  Latin America.

                  In 1662, the Franciscan friar Bartolomé de Letona wrote of
                  Manila, “All things necessary to human life [are found there]
                  and even articles of superfluity, ostentation, pomp, and
                  luxury. . . . The diversity of the peoples . . . who are seen
                  in Manila and its environs is the greatest in the world.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-introduction2-fn1" id="page-introduction2-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Letona’s wonder was echoed by other early modern chroniclers
                  who remarked on the cosmopolitanism of the city, its
                  multiethnic populace, and the quantity of finished goods,
                  spices, gems, and other global curiosities that could be found
                  there. The Italian adventurer Giovanni Francesco Gemelli
                  Careri, writing in <em>Giro del Mondo</em> (1699), was even
                  more fulsome in his description:

                  From Manila’s Parián market—the Philippine clearinghouse for
                  exports from across Asia—these riches were transshipped to the
                  Americas. Having survived the treacherous journey on a galleon
                  across the Pacific, these novel and sumptuous goods were
                  unloaded in Acapulco and transported to the capital of New
                  Spain and across the viceregal territories and beyond. For
                  over two hundred fifty years, this trade, both licit and
                  clandestine, connected vast distances, goods, and peoples.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Compelled by the ambition and precarity of the venture and the
                  great wealth and human suffering that it embodied, historians
                  have long been drawn to the saga of the galleon trade. Art
                  historians, in particular, have been inspired by the complex
                  objects created within this global network of exchange—from
                  Asian porcelains, lacquer objects, and silk to
                  <em>biombos</em>, <em>talavera poblana</em>, and
                  <em>enconchados</em> (figs. 1–3). As curators, these
                  glittering wares inspire us for many of the same reasons that
                  they fascinated the merchants of Manila and Mexico City and
                  their eager clients in the Parián markets. Art history as a
                  discipline may be reconsidering the notion of hybridity, but
                  the plurality of these objects in motion remains a central
                  component of their nature and enduring appeal.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-introduction2-fn3" id="page-introduction2-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>

                  This is the third time that the Mayer Center symposium has
                  addressed the theme of Asian and Latin American exchange. The
                  first symposium—<em>Asia and Spanish America: Trans-Pacific Artistic and
                    Cultural Exchange, 1500–1850</em>—was organized in 2006 by Donna Pierce and Ronald Otsuka. Its
                  focus was largely unidirectional, exploring the influence of
                  Asian goods on the furniture, decorative arts, textiles, and
                  painting of Mexico. This groundbreaking symposium was a
                  watershed for this emerging field. The second symposium, in
                  2010,
                  <em>At the Crossroads: The Arts of Spanish America and Early
                    Global Trade, 1492–1850</em>, was also organized by Pierce and Otsuka. Here, they
                  revisited many of the themes explored in the first convening,
                  but expanded the timeframe and markets for Asian goods to also
                  include the impact of Asian export goods on colonial New
                  England and the early American Republic.

                <p>
                  <em>Transpacific Engagements: Visual Culture of Global Exchange
                    (1781</em>–<em>1869)</em>, a conference held in 2014 in the
                  Philippines, marked another important step forward for the
                  field. Centering both the conference in and its narrative on
                  Manila, the organizers considered the impact of the galleon
                  trade on artistic production within the Philippine
                  <em>entrepôt</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-introduction2-fn4" id="page-introduction2-fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>

                <p>
                  When organizing the 2024 Mayer Center symposium, we similarly
                  strove to center Manila within this global narrative and to
                  expand our understanding of this complex node of exchange. One
                  underrepresented component of transpacific studies, at least
                  art historically, has been the impact of Latin America on the
                  Philippines and its trading partners. The importation of raw
                  materials from the Americas impacted local production in Asia,
                  including the extensive use of cochineal in Chinese silks and
                  brocades (fig. 4). Finished goods also flowed the other way
                  and had a profound influence on Asian art and culture. In
                  fact, some objects were transshipped multiple times, passing
                  between Asian, European, and Latin American ports, finding
                  reuse—and sometimes refashioning—in each location.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One critical advancement in the eighteen years since the first
                  symposium is a more nuanced understanding of the vital role
                  that China had on art and life in the Philippines during this
                  period. Fujianese merchants and artisans living in the
                  Philippines represented an important and sizable community;
                  they considered Manila a central node in their expansive
                  network of trade routes that spanned much of East and
                  Southeast Asia.

                  The 2024 Mayer Center symposium brought together emerging and
                  established scholars advancing different aspects of
                  transpacific studies. The first two essays consider the
                  individuals impacted by the galleon trade. Opening the volume,
                  <strong>Diego Javier Luis</strong>’s “The Manila Galleon: An
                  Historical Primer” provides a concise overview of this complex
                  history and forefronts the movement of people and human costs
                  associated with the galleon trade. He argues that we cannot
                  consider the aesthetic and cultural impact of global trade
                  without also considering the individual stories of loss,
                  enslavement, and displacement associated with it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Turning to those who enjoyed the abundance of the galleon
                  trade, <strong>Jorge F. Rivas Pérez</strong>’s essay,
                  “Inventories of Luxury and Wealth: Asian Trade and Material
                  Culture in Spanish America,” mines the posthumous inventories
                  associated with four elites in Mexico City and Lima. He
                  interprets this rich archive to consider how Asian objects
                  were integrated into domestic interiors and used in the
                  Americas during the long eighteenth century.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Multiple essays in the volume focus on objects in specific
                  media. Two center on Asian textiles.
                  <strong>Karina H. Corrigan</strong> explores the global
                  circulation of Chinese silk during the early galleon trade in
                  “‘Brocades of Gold and Silver upon Silk’: A Microhistory of a
                  Set of Chinese Silk Church Vestments for the Spanish Market.”
                  Corrigan approaches this rare surviving set as a document,
                  reading a history of an interwoven globe in the structure and
                  pattern of these resplendent ecclesiastical textiles.
                  Exploring a less well-known luxury textile,
                  <strong>Abi Lua</strong> considers <em>piña</em>, the
                  celebrated Philippine cloth made of pineapple-leaf, in “Cut
                  from the World: Philippine Piña Fabric in the East India
                  Marine Society Collection.” Lua documents the journey of a
                  nineteenth-century fragment of piña from the island of Panay
                  to Salem, Massachusetts. Collected by an American sailor in
                  the decades after the Manila galleon route had collapsed, this
                  piña fragment became an “article of curiosity” for scientific
                  inquiry in the collection of the East India Marine Society, a
                  predecessor institution to the Peabody Essex Museum.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Two essays explore artistic exchange in ceramics. In his
                  contribution, <strong>Roberto Junco</strong> considers the
                  importation of Chinese porcelain through surviving potsherds
                  in “An Ocean of Blue and White: Archaeological Excavations at
                  the Port of Acapulco.” These fragments, which likely arrived
                  broken after their long transpacific crossing, reveal both the
                  shifting tastes of consumers in Mexico and the styles that
                  influenced the enterprising potters of Puebla. Deposits of
                  these sherds have also identified the likely locations of the
                  old fort of San Diego and the annual Acapulco Fair that
                  assembled to distribute goods arriving on the Manilla Galleon.
                  <strong>Margaret E. Connors McQuade</strong> considers the
                  artisans in the colonial city of Puebla who reimagined Chinese
                  porcelain designs on talavera in “Name that Pot! Viceregal
                  Potters and Workshops of Puebla de los Ángeles.” Many of the
                  Puebla potters are well-documented archivally, but it has
                  historically been difficult to link them to specific works.
                  Connors McQuade argues for the attribution of select works
                  based, in part, on makers’ marks that potters incorporated
                  into their works.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The remaining essays in the volume reflect the enduring impact
                  of the galleon trade on cross-cultural works in a variety of
                  media. In “For the Consolation of Manila: A Case Study of a
                  New Spanish Image of Christ,”
                  <strong>Ronda Kasl</strong> considers an image of the ecce
                  homo sent to Manila to console a city beleaguered by poverty,
                  conflict, and natural disasters. She documents the object’s
                  creation in Mexico from cornstalk paste, its transmission on a
                  galleon—where it gained a reputation for miraculous powers—and
                  finally its arrival in the blighted Philippine capital, where
                  it became an important cult image.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Kathryn Santner</strong>’s contribution, “The Other
                  Silver Flow: Liturgical Objects in the Philippines,” discusses
                  the production of silver by <em>sangley</em> and Indigenous
                  silversmiths in Manila to satisfy the needs of the
                  archipelago’s churches. While Chinese artisans in Manila have
                  mostly been appraised for their work as ivory carvers,
                  immigrants from Fujian and Guangdong were also master
                  silversmiths and made up the bulk of the artisans in the city.
                  These craftsmen furnished churches in the Philippines with the
                  liturgical objects that mediated the profound sacramental
                  relationships between parishioners and the divine.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Turning to the understudied topic of furniture in “A Cabinet
                  of Many Cultures,” <strong>Clement Onn</strong> discusses a
                  seventeenth-century narra wood cabinet featuring Mexican
                  imagery of the founding of Tenochtitlan: an eagle atop a
                  cactus flanked by the figures of a Mexica ruler
                  (<em>tlatoani</em>) and a noblewoman. Onn argues convincingly
                  for the cabinet’s production in the Philippines and, drawing
                  on influences from European and Chinese furniture, traces the
                  visual and tangible history of a truly global object.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In “‘Graceful, Rich, and Pleasing to the Eye’: Seamless
                  Facture Across the Pacific,”
                  <strong>Samuel Frédéric Luterbacher</strong> examines lacquer
                  objects at the intersection of Japanese and Iberian
                  aesthetics. He explores seamlessness, a flawless surface
                  quality that resonated across cultures and obscured the labor
                  of an object’s creation. That such facture was associated with
                  miraculous creation and luxury goods speaks to the increasing
                  emphasis on commodification during this time period.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Closing the volume, “<em>Biombas</em> in Modern Mexican
                  Interiors,” by <strong>Aldo Solano Rojas</strong>, discusses
                  the afterlives of <em>biombos</em> (folding screens) in
                  twentieth-century domestic interiors in Mexico. Initially
                  imported from Japan to the Americas, screens quickly became
                  such a part of local visual culture that they came to be an
                  emblem of Mexicanness. Modernist furniture designers and
                  architects abstracted the form, utilizing biombos in the
                  homes, cinemas, and hotels they designed. Their contemporary
                  appropriation of this quintessential form attests to the
                  enduring legacy of the galleon trade over a century after its
                  cessation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The 2024 Mayer Center symposium brought together scholars with
                  diverse areas of expertise to advance transpacific material
                  culture studies. It also sought to lay the groundwork for
                  future exhibitions exploring this complex and fascinating
                  narrative. In the last twenty-five years, several important
                  exhibitions have explored the themes connected to the galleon
                  trade.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-introduction2-fn5" id="page-introduction2-fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>
                  Most recently,
                  <em>Across the Pacific: Art and the Manila Galleons</em>,
                  organized by Clement Onn for the Asian Civilisations Museum in
                  Singapore, offered an expansive view of the artistic
                  cross-pollination fostered by the galleon trade. But, despite
                  the captivating nature of objects produced over three
                  centuries of contact between Asia, the Americas, and Europe,
                  this subject remains unfamiliar to many American audiences.
                  Our hope is that these proceedings will inspire new
                  scholarship and exhibitions that will continue to mine the
                  complex and expansive narratives of the world’s first global
                  network.

                  The early modern Spanish domain was an empire that, on paper,
                  stretched across half the globe. The Treaty of Tordesillas in
                  1494 had infamously divided most of the world in two and
                  established the vertical meridian that separated Portuguese
                  claims from those of the Spanish. At the moment of the
                  treaty’s signing, Spanish overseas ambitions were oriented
                  toward reaching Asia via the Atlantic Ocean. Of course, the
                  American continents would prove a significant hindrance to
                  this mission, and due to their relative proximity to the
                  Iberian Peninsula, they would receive considerably more
                  European contact than later colonies in Asia. Consequently,
                  most scholars studying Spain’s empire have prioritized the
                  American hemisphere. However, as Elizabeth Horodowich and
                  Alexander Nagel have argued, the Americas and Asia were rarely
                  imagined as separate entities, even late into the sixteenth
                  century.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-01luis-essay-fn1" id="page-01luis-essay-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                  The Spanish domain—extending all the way to Asia’s eastern
                  shores—was considered contiguous (fig. 1). As such, the study
                  of Spanish empire in the Americas cannot be conducted in
                  isolation of the empire’s extension across the Pacific.

                  In the years immediately following the fall of the Mexica
                  capital of Tenochtitlan in 1521, numerous expeditions sailed
                  into the Pacific Ocean from the Americas in search of the
                  route to Asia.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-01luis-essay-fn2" id="page-01luis-essay-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                  It would take more than forty years for Spanish ships to
                  successfully sail back from Asia to the Americas. The first
                  was a small vessel called the <em>San Pedro</em> with an
                  Afro-Portuguese navigator named Lope Martín at the helm.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-01luis-essay-fn3" id="page-01luis-essay-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                  That crossing from the Philippine archipelago to Mexico via
                  the North Pacific in 1565 was a watershed historical moment.
                  It made possible the establishment of a regular trade route
                  across the Pacific between Asia and the Americas and, through
                  this link, the founding of long-term Spanish colonies in the
                  Philippines. As scholars of the Spanish Pacific have made
                  abundantly clear, these developments would have enormous
                  economic, demographic, and cultural repercussions for both
                  sides of the ocean.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-01luis-essay-fn4" id="page-01luis-essay-fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>

                <p>
                  The Spanish ships that sailed this transpacific trade route
                  from Cavite, Philippines, to Acapulco, Mexico, are called the
                  Manila galleons, and they operated from 1571 to 1815 (fig.
                  2).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-01luis-essay-fn5" id="page-01luis-essay-fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>
                  Since the publication of William Schurz’s landmark book,
                  <em>The Manila Galleon</em>, in 1939, scholarship on these
                  ships has developed mainly in two directions.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-01luis-essay-fn6" id="page-01luis-essay-fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>
                  First, there is the trade itself, the material circulation at
                  the heart of transpacific colonialism and the principal reason
                  Spaniards in Mexico invested so heavily in colonial ventures
                  in the Philippines. Silver mined by coerced and often enslaved
                  Indigenous, African, and Afro-descended laborers in the
                  Americas flowed across the Pacific. Through predominantly
                  Fujianese merchants in Manila’s Parián (Chinese quarter), that
                  silver ended up not only on the Chinese mainland but
                  throughout the region.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-01luis-essay-fn7" id="page-01luis-essay-fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>
                  In return, merchants, sailors, and elites brought back
                  precious porcelainware, refined and unrefined silk, textiles,
                  furniture, devotional images, and much more for consumers in
                  the Americas and western Europe. This trade fueled the
                  emergence and coherence of a truly global economy that
                  regularly connected all oceans in both directions for the
                  first time in world history.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-01luis-essay-fn8" id="page-01luis-essay-fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>

                  Second, the ships conveying trade goods simultaneously
                  facilitated the movement of European, Indigenous, African,
                  Afro-descended, Asian, Pacific Islander, and mixed people in
                  both directions across the Pacific. Some of these populations
                  were transient, while others settled permanently far from
                  their homelands. In my previous work, I have studied the
                  movement of over twenty thousand free and enslaved Asians to
                  the Americas, which long predated the conventional
                  nineteenth-century origins of Asian migration to the Western
                  Hemisphere.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-01luis-essay-fn9" id="page-01luis-essay-fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>
                  Much work remains to be done to follow the mobility of
                  Indigenous and Black people from the Americas into the
                  Pacific.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Traditionally, the themes of global trade and human mobility
                  have been siloed as separate fields with limited overlap. One
                  either studies objects or people, not both. In part, this
                  bifurcation is not just a problem of disciplinary boundaries
                  but one of archives. The very sources documenting the crates
                  upon crates of Asian wares entering Acapulco silence or, at
                  best, vastly minimize the presence, activities, and
                  subjectivities of marginalized colonial subjects. Yet, these
                  subjects were there, always just out of frame. On the galleons
                  and even after disembarkation, the histories of goods and the
                  people who handled them were, indeed, deeply entangled. In the
                  case of the enslaved, humans <em>were</em> the commercial
                  products. People were bought and sold alongside precious
                  porcelain. From the late sixteenth to late seventeenth
                  centuries, Déborah Oropeza estimates that anywhere between
                  3,776 and 10,000 enslaved Asians arrived in Mexico on the
                  galleons.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-01luis-essay-fn10" id="page-01luis-essay-fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup>
                  These numbers do not include the transpacific trafficking in
                  Africans and Afro-descendants that persisted into the
                  eighteenth century after the abolition of
                  <em>chino</em> (Asian) enslavement in 1672.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-01luis-essay-fn11" id="page-01luis-essay-fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup>
                  That the Manila galleons were slave ships should add a wrinkle
                  to grandiose narratives that unflinchingly celebrate the
                  arrival of luxurious Asian goods in the Americas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  More broadly, the commercial value of transpacific trade had
                  an immeasurable impact on the experiences of people crossing
                  the world’s largest ocean. On the galleons, everyone from the
                  ship’s commander and navigator down to the poorest sailors
                  carried goods from the Philippines to be sold in Acapulco or
                  anywhere from Mexico to Peru. In fact, the opportunity to sell
                  a trunk of Asian wares after disembarking was a major
                  incentive for sailors to risk their lives crossing the
                  Pacific. The route left so many dead that such a policy was
                  necessary to keep the ships fully staffed.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-01luis-essay-fn12" id="page-01luis-essay-fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The voyage from the Philippines to Mexico typically lasted an
                  excruciating five to six months, sometimes more, sometimes
                  less. The ships navigated from Cavite and through the Visayas
                  before exiting the Philippine archipelago through the
                  Embocadero and rising to the latitude of Japan to cross the
                  tumultuous North Pacific eastward. Then, after spotting Cape
                  Mendocino in California, they dropped south past Baja
                  California—careful to avoid the rocky coast—until hitting
                  Mazatlán to the east and continuing south. Finally, the ships
                  sailed into the protected Bay of Acapulco and anchored under
                  the guns of the Fort of San Diego (fig. 3).

                  Free and enslaved Asian sailors were almost always the
                  majority on Spanish ships sailing this route. Most served as
                  <em>grumetes</em> (cabin boys); that is to say, they were the
                  lowest-ranking crew members who received the lowest pay and
                  rations. While most grumetes were from Luzon in the
                  Philippines, a handful originated from elsewhere in coastal
                  Asia. Meanwhile, most of the enslaved—who also performed
                  sailing duties onboard—were either from South Asia or
                  elsewhere in the Philippines. The survival of all and the
                  maintenance of transpacific trade depended on the labor of

                  The experience of sailing on a transpacific galleon was unlike
                  that of any other early modern Spanish trade route, precisely
                  because of the high valuation of galleon cargos. In 1605,
                  Hernando de los Ríos Coronel wrote that galleon commanders
                  would overload their ships with trade goods to maximize the
                  profit of each voyage despite royal orders capping the value
                  of the cargo. Consequently, there was very little room below
                  the deck to accommodate people. Only a privileged few could
                  afford to rent a cabin. The rest, including the grumetes and
                  the enslaved, slept exposed to the elements, either partially
                  under one of the galleons’ two superstructures or simply
                  uncovered on the deck itself. Many froze in the North
                  Pacific.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-01luis-essay-fn14" id="page-01luis-essay-fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup>

                  Full cargos meant that galleons often sailed with low stocks
                  of food as well. According to Coronel, galleon officials often
                  stored what food there was topside, where storms often swept
                  it away. Sailors and officers were expected to supplement
                  shipboard rations with their own supplies. The wealthier
                  brought aboard live animals. The rest subsisted on a little
                  fresh food during the first month of the voyage and then
                  maggoty rice and hardtack during the rest. Malnourished
                  sailors also fished on calm days and snared unfortunate birds
                  resting their wings on the ship. Inevitably, crew members
                  without access to live animals developed scurvy, dysentery,
                  and beriberi by the end of the voyage.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-01luis-essay-fn15" id="page-01luis-essay-fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup>
                  People were considered expendable; valuable goods were not.

                  The problem of lading space was so severe that cannons were
                  similarly an afterthought. Galleons beset by privateers lacked
                  the means to fight back. The most extreme example of this
                  reality was the fate of the <em>San Diego</em>, a fully loaded
                  galleon that brought aboard cannons to fight off the Dutch
                  Oliver van Noort’s attack on Manila in 1600. Under the command
                  of the chronicler Antonio de Morga, the vessel sailed in
                  pursuit of the <em>Mauritius</em>, the Dutch flagship. The
                  weight of merchandise, cannons, and three hundred to four
                  hundred soldiers and sailors contributed to the
                  <em>San Diego</em>’s sudden sinking during combat despite
                  successfully boarding the enemy vessel. Interestingly enough,
                  merchandise recovered from the wreck of the
                  <em>San Diego</em> during the 1990s remains one of the best
                  sources to visualize the vast scope of the cargo on the Manila
                  galleons (figs. 4 and 5).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-01luis-essay-fn16" id="page-01luis-essay-fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup>

                  All of these factors contributed to the immense loss of life
                  that became a defining reality of the transpacific crossing.
                  It was not unusual for a “successful voyage” to lose 30
                  percent or more of its crew. When Pedro Cubero Sebastián made
                  the crossing toward the end of the seventeenth century, only
                  192 of the original 400 onboard survived. Similarly, in 1616,
                  150 out of the ship’s 200 crew members died, primarily due to
                  a lack of provisions.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-01luis-essay-fn17" id="page-01luis-essay-fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup>
                  Survivors were often hospitalized for months in Acapulco, and
                  some failed to return to health and perished on land. In
                  total, thousands died, though no reliable estimates of
                  casualties exist. This was the true cost of the transpacific
                  trade. People were made to give their lives for every Asian
                  product unloaded in Mexico.

                  After disembarkation at Acapulco, following the confluence of
                  objects and people leads us to other unexpected histories
                  beyond formal sites of exchange at trade fairs and urban
                  plazas. In fact, much of the cargo changed hands through
                  informal means. Outside of the marketplace, non-elites gained
                  access to Asian products. Middling merchants led mule trains
                  through the central Mexican highlands, up the coast to
                  Zihuatanejo, and further north to Guadalajara. On the way,
                  they passed through smaller
                  <em>pueblos de indios</em> (Indigenous towns) and peddled
                  their wares to buyers with access to silver coins, cacao
                  beans, and other goods for barter. One of these many merchants
                  was Domingo de Villalobos, a thirty-one-year-old Kapampangan
                  man from the Philippines. He lived on the Colima–Guadalajara
                  trade corridor in Tzapotlan (also Zapotlán). From his will in
                  1618, we can approximate the inventory that these informal
                  traders brought to small towns and scattered populations
                  outside of urban centers in central Mexico:

                  The inventory makes clear that Villalobos was a socially
                  mobile, even fashionable, chino merchant operating in rural
                  zones of Nueva Galicia to the northwest of Mexico City. He
                  owed his commercial success to trade in both local commodities
                  and Asian products. For example, he had large quantities of
                  salt either in his possession, in that of intermediaries, or
                  owed to him. Salt flowed from the Pacific coasts to Indigenous
                  consumers in the highlands, and Villalobos was clearly an
                  agent of this trade.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-01luis-essay-fn20" id="page-01luis-essay-fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, of particular interest here are his dealings in Asian
                  goods, which were primarily fabrics and clothing, including
                  Chinese cotton, silks, and taffeta. Acapulco was the source of
                  these products, where Villalobos had a contact, a fellow
                  Kapampangan man named Agustín. Villalobos likely traveled with
                  his nine mules and a horse to the port when galleons were
                  anchored in the bay to make purchases for rural consumers
                  desiring to craft their own clothing using Chinese silks and
                  wool.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Villalobos seems to have kept the best items for himself,
                  though. He must have struck quite an image rolling into town
                  with a purple-trimmed cloak, leather jerkin, silk breeches,
                  Japanese garters, a silk-embroidered Japanese sash,
                  Chinese-cotton socks, hat, and a katana on his sword belt.
                  Then again, other merchants with access to Acapulco had finery
                  of this quality as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                  From his homeland, Villalobos kept only several petticoats
                  that he described as “colorful” and made of “cotton.” These
                  items clearly had sentimental value. When Villalobos fell
                  sick, he stayed in the house of his close business associate
                  (and likely friend), a fellow Kapampangan man named Alonso
                  Gutiérrez. Gutiérrez’s wife, an Indigenous woman named
                  <em>doña</em> Mariana, nursed Villalobos back to health. When
                  he recovered, Villalobos publicly gifted one of these
                  petticoats to doña Mariana.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-01luis-essay-fn21" id="page-01luis-essay-fnref21" class="footnote-ref-anchor">21</a></sup>
                  Sadly, Villalobos relapsed into illness and returned to
                  Gutiérrez’s home, where he was bedridden for seven months
                  before passing away.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-01luis-essay-fn22" id="page-01luis-essay-fnref22" class="footnote-ref-anchor">22</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  As exceptional as a character like Villalobos might initially
                  seem, his will makes abundantly clear that there were many
                  other Kapampangan and Asian merchants operating in pueblos de
                  indios in colonial Mexico. Like other mule train drivers
                  connected to Acapulco, they facilitated the wide dispersion of
                  Asian products to communities otherwise unlikely to buy the
                  finest wares at the main plaza in Mexico City. In this case,
                  diasporic Philippine networks made such exchanges
                  possible.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-01luis-essay-fn23" id="page-01luis-essay-fnref23" class="footnote-ref-anchor">23</a></sup>

                  The entanglement of the movement of goods and people extended
                  across the Atlantic to Spain as well. In 1623, a prominent
                  Spanish judge in Mexico hired a Japanese man named Juan
                  Antonio to accompany a Japanese bed being shipped as a gift to
                  the recently crowned Spanish king, Philip IV.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-01luis-essay-fn24" id="page-01luis-essay-fnref24" class="footnote-ref-anchor">24</a></sup>
                  His predecessors, Philip II and Philip III, had already hosted
                  impressive Japanese embassies traveling to Rome and received
                  lavish gifts that can still be seen in the Real Armería (Royal
                  Armory) in Madrid today. Upon arrival at the royal court, Juan
                  Antonio presented the king with a letter from the judge
                  stating that this man could repair the bed if it had arrived
                  damaged. He could also fix <em>biombos</em> (Japanese screen
                  panels) or any other Japanese product. In the king’s presence,
                  Juan Antonio assembled the bed (fig. 6).

                  However, the rest of his stay in Spain would be nothing so
                  glamorous. Like many Asian subjects who arrived at the seat of
                  the empire, Juan Antonio soon found himself stranded with no
                  means of returning overseas. He was merely a disposable
                  accessory to the judge’s gift. Subsequently, Juan Antonio
                  submitted multiple petitions to the Crown begging for
                  employment as a soldier, an interpreter, and eventually, as a
                  sailor so that he could earn enough money to return to
                  Mexico.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-01luis-essay-fn25" id="page-01luis-essay-fnref25" class="footnote-ref-anchor">25</a></sup>
                  For him, there was no separating material fascination with
                  Asian products from his long-distance displacement. His entire
                  existence had been reduced to the service of a gift.

                  The disciplinary boundaries that often silo the study of
                  objects and people have obscured the extent to which both were
                  historically inseparable. Searching for their many
                  intersections brings us to understudied histories, like the
                  harrowing nature of the Pacific passage, the mule trains
                  crisscrossing colonial Mexican hinterlands, and the rare case
                  of a Japanese man accompanying a bed sent to the king of
                  Spain. These examples merely scratch the surface, but in their
                  brevity, they also prove that the texture of history—the lived
                  experience of it—constantly and triumphantly resists the
                  fragile categories we are trained to harness it with. I find
                  it more liberating to surrender to the innumerable ways the
                  messiness of history challenges the way we think, with its
                  fantastical idiosyncrasies. To study the storied galleons and
                  the ways in which the transpacific trade remade the early
                  modern world is to embark on an inward journey—alongside that
                  of our historical subjects—because the value of doing history
                  is not simply in reassembling the past into new configurations
                  but, rather, in how it forces us to constantly reform the
                  tools we deploy to perceive our world and its past.

                  Beginning in the early 1570s, with the regular annual Pacific
                  crossing, the Spanish viceroyalties of New Spain and Peru
                  became key nodes in a vast global trade network that connected
                  major cities in Asia, the Americas, and Europe. The Manila
                  Galleon (known then as <em>nao de China</em>) trade
                  transported immense quantities of Asian goods—textiles,
                  porcelain, furniture, lacquerware, jewelry, ivories, and other
                  finely crafted luxury goods—across the Pacific Ocean to the
                  Americas in exchange for silver and other raw materials such
                  as indigo and cochineal. These exotic items found eager
                  markets in the thriving new cities across Spanish America, in
                  particular in metropolises such as Mexico City and Lima, where
                  they significantly and visibly influenced local visual and
                  material culture.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The influx of these Asian imports ignited the imaginations of
                  both consumers and artisans in the Americas. Sumptuous
                  textiles, fine porcelain, lacquer furniture, ivory sculptures,
                  and other lavish objects became symbols of status and wealth
                  and inspired local craftspeople to incorporate Asian motifs
                  and techniques into their creations (fig. 1). This blending of
                  Asian and local styles led to a unique cross-cultural
                  synthesis, visible in everything from architecture and
                  decoration to clothing and everyday objects (fig. 2).

                  Although much has been written about colonial society, we
                  still know relatively little about customs regarding material
                  culture and everyday life, particularly the role of objects in
                  these societies. Published documents—in particular
                  inventories—from the colonial period remain limited, and
                  accessing original sources in Latin America often presents
                  bureaucratic challenges and numerous other difficulties.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is precisely why I have undertaken this opportunity to
                  explore the context in which luxurious Asian goods for the
                  home were used during the viceregal era. In Spanish America,
                  Asian imports appear listed almost everywhere, from ship
                  manifests to dowry contracts, wills, inventories, and
                  appraisals of every possible type. However, records tend to be
                  succinct and merely name the items without providing
                  additional information. Yet, some inventories offer more
                  detailed information on the specifics of the objects,
                  generally indicating quality or appearance, and more
                  importantly, some documents include information on how they
                  were used and displayed. The latter is a crucial aspect as
                  most scholarship on Asian export goods tends to focus more on
                  the type of items and their quantity rather than on their role
                  in daily life.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Documents of wealthier households typically list a substantial
                  number of Asian items of the finest kind. Yet, the variety and
                  abundance of imported goods across Spanish America allowed
                  even the less affluent strata of viceregal societies to access
                  them, even if of lower quality. Whether it was an aristocrat
                  or a wealthy merchant displaying a costly service of armorial
                  porcelain made to order in China (figs. 3 and 4) or a rich
                  lady wearing a lavish dress made from Chinese silk (fig. 5) or
                  an individual of the middle class wearing a more affordable
                  printed cotton garment (fig. 6) or the use of a simple
                  porcelain bowl in the kitchen (fig. 7), imported goods were
                  present across all social classes. It is important to note
                  that the so-called Parián market in Mexico City was a key
                  retail hub for global imports, while in Lima, through the port
                  of Callao, local merchants retailed a wide range of imported
                  products, chiefly coming from Portobello (Panama), to supply
                  Peru’s interior provinces.

                  Few Asian artifacts from this era have survived to the
                  present, and nearly all are detached from their original
                  historical context, complicating their study. Additionally,
                  there have been limited archaeological investigations into
                  this topic, with most focusing on porcelain fragments
                  preserved in landfills, which, by their nature, remain in
                  relatively good condition and close to their original
                  location. However, documents showcase the depth and durability
                  of the transpacific connections between Asia and the Americas
                  that emerged in the late sixteenth century, revealing a
                  vibrant and enduring cultural exchange.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The present study focuses on four elite individuals: two
                  viceroys—Manuel de Oms y Santa Pau (1651–1710), Marquess of
                  Castelldosrius, Viceroy of Peru from 1707 to 1710; and Antonio
                  María de Bucareli y Ursúa (1717–1779), Viceroy of New Spain
                  from 1771 until his death in 1779—and two noblewomen—<em>doña</em>
                  Teresa Francisca María de Guadalupe Retes Paz y Vera
                  (1673–1695), Marchioness of San Jorge from Mexico City; and
                  <em>doña</em> Rosa Juliana Sánchez de Tagle e Hidalgo
                  (1687–1761), Marchioness of Torre Tagle from Lima.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By no means exhaustive, the study aims to provide an analysis
                  based on four sets of documents: two from New Spain, published
                  and annotated by the late Mexican scholar Gustavo Curiel,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-02rivas-essay-fn1" id="page-02rivas-essay-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                  and two from Peru, which I have examined extensively in my
                  previous research.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-02rivas-essay-fn2" id="page-02rivas-essay-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The selection of these particular documents is intentional.
                  They contain sufficient detail to provide insight into how
                  specific objects for the home were used in colonial society
                  while offering a perspective that spans nearly a century, from
                  the late seventeenth century to the late eighteenth century.
                  Through these sources, we can begin to reconstruct the role
                  that luxury material goods imported from Asia played in
                  shaping the daily lives and identities of the colonial elite
                  during this era. As is often the case with this type of
                  documentary sources, details about the pieces are sometimes
                  incomplete. Information such as the total number of items,
                  techniques used, themes depicted, dimensions, authorship, or
                  origin may be missing, making it challenging to fully
                  understand the collections. Jewels, clothing, and textiles of
                  Asian origin intended for personal use appear frequently in
                  the inventories studied. However, as they constitute a
                  distinct category, they have been excluded from this brief
                  text, which focuses primarily on household goods.

                  Members of the Spanish high nobility, the viceroys, served as
                  the monarch’s direct representatives, holding the highest
                  civic and military authority in Spanish America. They oversaw
                  the treasury, justice system, and secular aspects of
                  ecclesiastical governance. In Mexico City and Lima, the
                  viceroys lived and administered affairs from grand viceregal
                  palaces in each city’s main square (fig. 8). Each viceroy
                  furnished these official residences to their taste, so the
                  palaces’ appearances shifted with each new appointment.

                  The titled nobility in Spanish America primarily consisted of
                  the <em>criollo</em> elite—descendants of Spanish immigrants,
                  predominantly merchants or Crown administrators. This class
                  modeled itself after the Spanish nobility, adopting its
                  structure, privileges, and customs. Over time, they supplanted
                  the earlier elite of conquistadors and their descendants. As
                  landowners and merchants with economic resources, social
                  prestige, and political influence, this new nobility
                  consolidated wealth and power through strategic marriages of
                  convenience, often incorporating members of the remaining
                  conquistador families who still held land and wealth. The
                  titled nobility typically lived in large houses or palaces in
                  the city center. One example is the well-preserved palace of
                  the marquises of Torre Tagle in Lima, which now serves as the
                  seat of the Peruvian chancellery (fig. 9).

                  The analysis of the referenced documents reveals that Asian
                  artifacts were primarily displayed in spaces designed for
                  social representation—areas intended to showcase wealth and
                  status. Within these spaces, four main areas stand out: table
                  settings, reception rooms, the <em>estrado</em> (a woman’s
                  sitting area often used for formal gatherings), and bedrooms.
                  Each of these spaces served as a stage for presenting valuable
                  objects, demonstrating the owner’s affluence and taste for
                  exotic, expensive items. The presence of Asian artifacts in
                  these rooms not only reflected the wealth of the household but
                  also underscored a cultural appreciation for imported,
                  high-quality craftsmanship.

                <p>
                  <strong>Viceroy Manuel de Oms y Santa Pau, Lima (1710)</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Born in 1651 in Barcelona, Manuel de Oms y Santa Pau, first
                  Marquis of Castelldosrius, was appointed viceroy of Peru in
                  1704, in the midst of the War of the Spanish Succession. His
                  arrival in Lima in 1707 was not without controversy, largely
                  due to the enormous costs of his move to Peru. During his
                  administration, he faced a series of complex problems,
                  including economic instability, tensions between
                  <em>peninsulares</em> and creoles, and constant threats from
                  pirates and corsairs. Despite these difficulties, Oms y Santa
                  Pau, a cultured and educated man, tried to modernize the
                  colonial administration and strengthen royal power. However,
                  his tenure was marked by strife and accusations of corruption
                  until his death in office in 1710.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-02rivas-essay-fn3" id="page-02rivas-essay-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Undoubtedly, the years he lived as Spanish ambassador to the
                  French court marked his taste for the customs, styles, and
                  pomp of the Bourbons at Versailles, as evidenced by the
                  inventory of his possessions.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-02rivas-essay-fn4" id="page-02rivas-essay-fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                  Among other things, the viceroy had a luxurious
                  <em>casina</em>, or leisure pavilion, built in the middle of
                  the garden of the viceregal palace, an ideal place for his
                  literary evenings. Asian furniture and objects held a
                  prominent place in the reception rooms at this time. Though
                  its architectural features are unknown, this opulent space was
                  adorned with ten gilt-framed mirrors and twenty gilt consoles
                  displaying Chinese cups and figurines, among other valuable
                  objects.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-02rivas-essay-fn5" id="page-02rivas-essay-fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>
                  The seating, including chairs and canapés, featured gilded
                  legs and crimson damask upholstery with gold
                  <em>sevillaneta</em> trim, creating a setting of undeniable
                  splendor. The centrality of Asian objects in this room, the
                  most splendid of the palace and one used for entertaining
                  diplomats and the <em>limeño</em> nobility, indicates the
                  importance that society conferred on these exotic imported
                  goods.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The inventory of the marquis reveals numerous entries of
                  precious silks and other luxurious textiles. Although their
                  origins are not explicitly specified, it is reasonable to
                  assume that many of these items were imported from Asia. For
                  instance, in the audience room, the marquis had three curtains
                  of mother-of-pearl color damask and matching valances with
                  their gold trimmings, a hanging of red damask with silk and
                  gold trimmings and its valance of the same, and a crimson
                  velvet canopy adorned with gold embroidery, accompanied by a
                  matching chair and carpet, all complemented by crimson damask
                  wall hangings.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-02rivas-essay-fn6" id="page-02rivas-essay-fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>
                  While the exact provenance of these opulent textiles remains
                  unknown, their quality suggests a connection to the trade
                  networks of the time during which Asia had a central role.
                  Another instance in which rich textiles played a key role is
                  the bed. A grand, elaborately dressed bed was a staple of
                  stately homes and palaces, inspired by the opulence of royal
                  residences. Such beds could serve as parade beds, reserved for
                  social and ceremonial functions, or as everyday furnishings
                  for the owners. In either case, these extravagant pieces
                  symbolized wealth and refined taste. The marquis of
                  Castelldosrius owned several beds, though their geographic
                  origins are unspecified. Notably, the viceroy owned a cot of
                  <em>granadillo</em> wood featuring Solomonic columns, bronze
                  ornaments, a crimson damask skirt, two mattresses of the same
                  material, and a mosquito net,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-02rivas-essay-fn7" id="page-02rivas-essay-fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>a protection from the abundant insects common in the
                  Americas.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-02rivas-essay-fn8" id="page-02rivas-essay-fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>
                  At the time of its appraisal, this last bed was
                  undressed—likely due to the common practice of disposing of
                  bedding after a death to prevent the spread of disease, as the
                  marquis may have passed away in it. Nonetheless, the inventory
                  also included crimson damask bed hangings and a crimson
                  brocade canopy with a yellow base, luxurious textiles that
                  might have originated in Asia, as Chinese damask would likely
                  have been less expensive than Spanish or Italian silks.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-02rivas-essay-fn9" id="page-02rivas-essay-fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The marquis also owned inlaid furniture of possible Asian
                  origin, among which stand out two writing desks inlaid in
                  tortoiseshell, ivory, and mother-of-pearl and two smaller of
                  the same type with their matching tables.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-02rivas-essay-fn10" id="page-02rivas-essay-fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup>
                  Attentive to the tastes and needs of their new clientele,
                  Asian craftsmen swiftly adapted European furniture models,
                  embellishing them with traditional Asian techniques. They
                  often incorporated mother-of-pearl, bone, and ivory inlays,
                  along with the lustrous lacquer finishes highly prized in
                  Spain and its overseas territories.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Among all the inventories studied, that of the marquis is
                  undoubtedly the least informative regarding the geographical
                  origins of the inventoried objects. However, it is
                  particularly revealing in its detailed mention of the
                  geographical provenance of items within the garden pavilion,
                  specifically noting the Chinese origin of the porcelain. This
                  detail is especially significant, as the pavilion was the most
                  luxurious space in the viceregal palace, underscoring the
                  centrality of Asian objects as symbols of wealth and refined
                  taste in early eighteenth-century Lima.

                  <strong>Viceroy Antonio María de Bucareli y Ursúa, Mexico City
                    (1779)</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Born in Seville, Spain, in 1717, Antonio María de Bucareli y
                  Ursúa served as the forty-sixth viceroy of New Spain from 1771
                  until his death in office in 1779. The son of the second
                  Marquis of Vallehermoso and a member of a wealthy and
                  influential Sevillian family of Florentine origin, Bucareli
                  was a man of refined tastes and significant wealth.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-02rivas-essay-fn11" id="page-02rivas-essay-fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  As viceroy, Bucareli was celebrated for his effective
                  governance, extensive infrastructure improvements, and
                  dedication to implementing the Bourbon Reforms, aimed at
                  modernizing and strengthening Spain’s colonial administration.
                  His tenure was marked by efforts to enhance economic
                  conditions, promote public works, and expand trade. He played
                  a pivotal role in constructing roads, aqueducts, and other
                  essential infrastructure, significantly contributing to New
                  Spain’s economic development.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-02rivas-essay-fn12" id="page-02rivas-essay-fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The comprehensive inventory of Bucareli’s belongings, also
                  published and annotated by Curiel, offers a vivid depiction of
                  the splendor of the viceregal court in the late eighteenth
                  century. It also underscores the vast circulation of imported
                  Asian goods in New Spain, highlighting the region’s
                  integration into global trade networks during that era.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Intended for hosting formal events and celebrations, the
                  reception and audience rooms were typically the largest and
                  most public areas in viceregal palaces, serving as ideal
                  showcases for the viceroy’s wealth, taste, and power.
                  Inventories of these rooms often list only a few permanent
                  furniture pieces, as items were usually brought in from other
                  rooms and arranged according to the occasion. However,
                  reception rooms always featured an abundance of
                  seating—chairs, stools, benches, and settees—usually lined
                  along the walls.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In viceregal palaces and grand homes, multiple reception rooms
                  were standard, sometimes preceded by antechambers. As
                  previously mentioned in the case of Viceroy Oms y Santa Pau,
                  at the viceregal palace in Lima, a canopy room was always
                  present, distinguished by a rich armchair set upon a dais
                  under an opulent canopy, with portraits of the monarchs
                  displayed as a mark of reverence for the king during audiences
                  and official ceremonies. Viceroy Bucareli’s canopy room was
                  decorated with crimson damask from Valencia. Spanish silks,
                  though more difficult to obtain in Mexico and costly to
                  import, were closely associated with the royal court in
                  Madrid. Their exclusivity made them particularly fitting for
                  the canopy room, where the authority and prestige of the
                  monarch were symbolically represented, which contrasts with
                  the extensive use of Chinese textiles and a rich assortment of
                  Asian objects present in the rest of the palace.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-02rivas-essay-fn13" id="page-02rivas-essay-fnref13" class="footnote-ref-anchor">13</a></sup>
                  For example, in a cabinet adjacent to the oratory, there were
                  two Chinese lidded vases in various colors with wooden
                  bases,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-02rivas-essay-fn14" id="page-02rivas-essay-fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup>
                  another multicolored vase with gilded accents,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-02rivas-essay-fn15" id="page-02rivas-essay-fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup>
                  a Chinese <em>aporcelanado</em> (porcelain-like) armchair,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-02rivas-essay-fn16" id="page-02rivas-essay-fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup>
                  and a set of seating that included nineteen stools and a
                  settee, all upholstered in straw-colored damask.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-02rivas-essay-fn17" id="page-02rivas-essay-fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup>
                  Elsewhere in the viceregal palace, the inventory lists four
                  Chinese landscape paintings under glass framed in wood,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-02rivas-essay-fn18" id="page-02rivas-essay-fnref18" class="footnote-ref-anchor">18</a></sup>
                  twelve black lacquer wooden side chairs of Chinese origin, and
                  numerous curtains and wall hangings made from Chinese
                  damask.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-02rivas-essay-fn19" id="page-02rivas-essay-fnref19" class="footnote-ref-anchor">19</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Among the furnishings, Viceroy Bucareli’s bed is remarkable
                  for its extraordinary luxury; it had “a Chinese cabinet
                  hanging, of yellow satin, painted with stories and figures of
                  Chinese, on one side, and a bed hanging of the same color,
                  embroidered with colored silk on both sides, whose two
                  hangings are contained in two chests.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-02rivas-essay-fn20" id="page-02rivas-essay-fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup>
                  The set was valued at the extravagant sum of 1,400 pesos, and
                  the viceroy had left instructions that it be sent to his
                  beloved niece, the Countess of Xerena.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-02rivas-essay-fn21" id="page-02rivas-essay-fnref21" class="footnote-ref-anchor">21</a></sup>
                  In addition, the bedding included several “Peking” bedspreads
                  in various colors.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The service for the table was one of the areas with the
                  greatest variety of Asian goods in Bucareli’s inventory. It
                  reflects the shift in tastes typical of the late eighteenth
                  century, favoring Chinese porcelain over silver. His inventory
                  lists an impressive 1,161 pieces of Chinese porcelain,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-02rivas-essay-fn22" id="page-02rivas-essay-fnref22" class="footnote-ref-anchor">22</a></sup>

                  Among these are a 154-piece coffee set known as
                  <em>de la cabrita</em> (the little goat), a 104-piece set with
                  the viceroy’s arms, a 67-piece set <em>con cenefita</em> (with
                  a small fringe), a 136-piece set <em>del elefante</em> (of the

                  The porcelain pieces are richly varied in shape and style,

                  ducks, and lions,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-02rivas-essay-fn26" id="page-02rivas-essay-fnref26" class="footnote-ref-anchor">26</a></sup>
                  as well as human figures such as a pair of

                  The collection includes a wide array of plates, bowls of
                  various sizes, chocolate cups, <em>mancerinas</em> (a type of
                  wide saucer with a cup holder in the center), and serving

                  The most remarkable pieces in Viceroy Bucareli’s Chinese
                  tableware collection are undoubtedly the gilded
                  <em>copella</em> silver (silver and lead alloy) items
                  embellished with enamel, which the viceroy specifically set
                  aside for his niece, the Countess of Xerena. Born of Chinese
                  entrepreneurship, ingenuity, exceptional craftsmanship, and
                  cultural cosmopolitanism, silver objects crafted for export
                  were among the most coveted luxury goods, seamlessly blending
                  precious metals with sophisticated decorative techniques.
                  These exquisite pieces include two filigree pelicans that
                  served as salt cellars, adorned with gilded branches: a duck
                  and a heron, whose backs could be used to hold salt, each
                  perched on a rock and resting on small tables crafted from
                  white and gilded copella silver with enamel accents.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-02rivas-essay-fn32" id="page-02rivas-essay-fnref32" class="footnote-ref-anchor">32</a></sup>
                  Among these Chinese treasures for the table were also two
                  turkeys, one with its wings extended and the other tucked in,
                  with gilded and enameled tails, separated by a small gilded
                  and enameled tree mounted on its little table.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-02rivas-essay-fn33" id="page-02rivas-essay-fnref33" class="footnote-ref-anchor">33</a></sup>
                  Completing this set were four delicate
                  <em>ramilleteros</em> (ornate table centerpieces), each with
                  screws and small plates, decorated in intricate filigree with
                  tiny roses and gilded overlays.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-02rivas-essay-fn34" id="page-02rivas-essay-fnref34" class="footnote-ref-anchor">34</a></sup>
                  The viceroy also had a Chinese silver toothpick holder
                  embellished with filigree and gilding.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-02rivas-essay-fn35" id="page-02rivas-essay-fnref35" class="footnote-ref-anchor">35</a></sup>
                  Among other Chinese metalwork, the inventory lists a brass and
                  black enamel candlestick with its small plate, its snuffer,
                  and a wick trimmer.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-02rivas-essay-fn36" id="page-02rivas-essay-fnref36" class="footnote-ref-anchor">36</a></sup>

                  As the viceroy of New Spain, the king’s representative, and a
                  symbol of the magnificence of the Spanish court, Bucareli was
                  expected to uphold a high level of luxury and pomp in all
                  palace events. By the late eighteenth century, French court
                  customs—introduced to Spain with the Bourbon dynasty’s
                  ascension—were fully assimilated, further refining the
                  etiquette, fashion, and ceremonial splendor that defined the
                  viceroyalty’s elite social life. The lavishness, abundance,
                  and exquisite quality of Bucareli’s table settings reflect
                  both the wealth and grandeur of late eighteenth-century
                  banquets and galas, as well as the sophistication and
                  meticulous attention that elite society devoted to such
                  events.

                  <strong>The Marchioness of San Jorge, Mexico City (1695)</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Teresa Francisca María de Guadalupe Retes Paz y Vera
                  (1673–1695), Marchioness of San Jorge, was among the
                  wealthiest women in late-seventeenth-century Mexico City, as
                  the sole heir of the prosperous merchant<em>don</em> José de
                  Retes y Ortiz de Largacha. Despite her immense fortune,
                  Teresa’s life was marked by vulnerability; her intellectual
                  disability placed her under the guardianship of her uncles,
                  José Sáez de Retes and Dámaso de Saldívar, following her
                  father’s death. In 1688, she married her first cousin, don
                  Domingo de Retes, in what was likely a marriage of convenience
                  designed to preserve and manage her substantial estate. Her
                  life, however, was tragically short, ending at the age of
                  twenty-two.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-02rivas-essay-fn37" id="page-02rivas-essay-fnref37" class="footnote-ref-anchor">37</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The detailed inventory and appraisal of the marchioness’s
                  estate, also studied by Curiel, offer a vivid glimpse into the
                  wealth and sophistication of New Spain’s colonial elite in the
                  late 1600s, highlighting their affinity for luxury goods, in
                  particular fine imports from Asia.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As previously mentioned, lavishly decorated reception rooms
                  were standard in the houses of the titled nobility. Asian
                  luxury furniture and objects played a central role in wealth
                  display. For example, the marchioness of San Jorge owned a
                  substantial number of pieces of fine Asian furniture,
                  including four valuable Asian lacquer cabinets, appraised at
                  an impressive 450 pesos—a significant sum for the period.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-02rivas-essay-fn38" id="page-02rivas-essay-fnref38" class="footnote-ref-anchor">38</a></sup>
                  Beyond their exotic origin, lacquer objects and furniture held
                  a place of honor in the world of luxury goods. Their
                  waterproof, glossy surfaces, rich hues of red and black, and
                  intricate ornamentation in gold, silver, or mother-of-pearl
                  made them highly prized for their beauty and craftsmanship. In
                  addition to the cabinets, she also had two more Chinese
                  lacquer cabinets (<em>escritorios</em>), a small Chinese low
                  table (<em>bufetillo</em>), a Chinese lacquer chest, a Chinese
                  lacquer writing chest, and two cedar and narra wood boxes from
                  China, inlaid with bone (likely of Philippine origin), and an
                  additional wooden box made in China.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-02rivas-essay-fn39" id="page-02rivas-essay-fnref39" class="footnote-ref-anchor">39</a></sup>
                  The inventory further lists eleven small tables inlaid with
                  mother-of-pearl, though it does not specify these as Asian in
                  origin.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It was common for the titled nobility to maintain a canopy
                  room specially prepared for the hypothetical possibility of a
                  royal visit. It also served as a symbol of allegiance to the
                  Crown. The marchioness of San Jorge’s canopy was made of
                  crimson fabric with gold fringe; although further details are
                  not available, it is possible that the fabric was of Asian
                  origin.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-02rivas-essay-fn40" id="page-02rivas-essay-fnref40" class="footnote-ref-anchor">40</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The estrado was a dedicated area within the larger reception
                  room and, in some cases, an entire room, reserved for women to
                  engage in social activities and display their collections of
                  valuable objects. As the quintessential feminine space during
                  the viceroyalty, it often served as a focal point for
                  showcasing Asian export goods.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-02rivas-essay-fn41" id="page-02rivas-essay-fnref41" class="footnote-ref-anchor">41</a></sup>
                  In the case of the marchioness of San Jorge, her inventory
                  reveals a striking collection displayed inside an ebony and
                  ivory cabinet with glass doors, functioning as a sort of
                  treasure presentation with objects from all over the
                  world.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-02rivas-essay-fn42" id="page-02rivas-essay-fnref42" class="footnote-ref-anchor">42</a></sup>
                  Inside were numerous prized Asian pieces. These included two
                  small Chinese cups embellished with silver mounts, two other
                  silver-mounted cups with lids, four small Chinese jars
                  (<em>tibores</em>), and over seventy small porcelain items and
                  figurines from China.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-02rivas-essay-fn43" id="page-02rivas-essay-fnref43" class="footnote-ref-anchor">43</a></sup>
                  Additionally, there was a pair of Chinese wooden chests
                  embellished with silver nails.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-02rivas-essay-fn44" id="page-02rivas-essay-fnref44" class="footnote-ref-anchor">44</a></sup>
                  Seating in this room was provided by twenty-four Chinese
                  cushions, elaborately embroidered with gold and silver thread,
                  arranged on top of three exquisite Chinese carpets, completing
                  an opulent display.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The bedroom, generally adjacent to the estrado, was another
                  important room for social functions. The marchioness owned an
                  exquisite ebony and ivory bed with double Solomonic headboards
                  adorned with richly embroidered silk hangings from China.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-02rivas-essay-fn45" id="page-02rivas-essay-fnref45" class="footnote-ref-anchor">45</a></sup>
                  These hangings alone were appraised at 950 pesos, underscoring
                  their fine quality.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-02rivas-essay-fn46" id="page-02rivas-essay-fnref46" class="footnote-ref-anchor">46</a></sup>
                  In addition, the inventory lists several other Chinese
                  textiles, including a gauze hanging with a matching bedspread
                  embellished with gold flowers and fringe and another bed
                  hanging made of colorful satin with its ceiling and skirting
                  panels.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-02rivas-essay-fn47" id="page-02rivas-essay-fnref47" class="footnote-ref-anchor">47</a></sup>
                  Also featured are a green silk <em>ormesí</em> bedcover from
                  China, a door curtain, and a cotton bedcover embroidered in
                  green, likewise imported from China.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-02rivas-essay-fn48" id="page-02rivas-essay-fnref48" class="footnote-ref-anchor">48</a></sup>
                  The marchioness’s collection included a tall, twelve-panel
                  Chinese screen, likely used near the bed to provide privacy,
                  as was customary in that period.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-02rivas-essay-fn49" id="page-02rivas-essay-fnref49" class="footnote-ref-anchor">49</a></sup>
                  This screen not only served a practical function but also
                  enhanced the room’s aesthetic richness.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As in the other inventories previously mentioned, the service
                  for the table often included Asian export goods. Following the
                  custom of the late seventeenth century, the marchioness used
                  an extensive collection of silver for the table service, very
                  likely of Mexican origin, as silversmithing was highly
                  sophisticated in Mexico by the seventeenth century.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-02rivas-essay-fn50" id="page-02rivas-essay-fnref50" class="footnote-ref-anchor">50</a></sup>
                  However, in addition, she had a large cupboard filled with
                  Chinese porcelain for dining, although the exact contents are
                  not listed.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-02rivas-essay-fn51" id="page-02rivas-essay-fnref51" class="footnote-ref-anchor">51</a></sup>
                  The inventory, however, details other items in her collection
                  of Chinese porcelain in varying qualities—fine, semi-fine, and
                  ordinary—including numerous cups, bowls, plates, and lidded
                  jars.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-02rivas-essay-fn52" id="page-02rivas-essay-fnref52" class="footnote-ref-anchor">52</a></sup>
                  Another notable Asian item in her collection, reflecting her
                  passion for chocolate, was a set of a dozen Chinese lacquer
                  <em>jícaras</em> (chocolate cups), each paired with a matching
                  lacquer saucer.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-02rivas-essay-fn53" id="page-02rivas-essay-fnref53" class="footnote-ref-anchor">53</a></sup>

                  <strong>The Marchioness of Torre Tagle, Lima (1761)</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Rosa Juliana Sánchez de Tagle e Hidalgo (1687–1761), future
                  Marchioness of Torre Tagle, was born in San Jerónimo de Sayán,
                  Huaura (Peru), to don Francisco Sánchez de Tagle y Castro
                  Velarde, a Spanish nobleman and prosperous merchant, and doña
                  María Josefa Hidalgo Sánchez y Velázquez Gómez, a wealthy
                  heiress of Spanish descent.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-02rivas-essay-fn54" id="page-02rivas-essay-fnref54" class="footnote-ref-anchor">54</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  On November 13, 1707, Rosa Juliana married her distant cousin,
                  don José Bernardo de Tagle Bracho, in Lima’s cathedral. With
                  Rosa Juliana’s substantial dowry and her father’s backing,
                  José Bernardo rapidly amassed a fortune through commerce. His
                  social ascent culminated in the title of Marquis of Torre
                  Tagle, granted by King Felipe V in 1730 for his services to
                  the Crown. This honor elevated the family’s status, cementing
                  their position among the Peruvian elite.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The detailed inventory and appraisal of the marchioness’s
                  estate provide a remarkable window into the opulence and
                  refined lifestyle of Lima’s colonial elite during the first
                  half of the 1700s.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-02rivas-essay-fn55" id="page-02rivas-essay-fnref55" class="footnote-ref-anchor">55</a></sup>
                  These records reveal not only the vast wealth amassed by
                  prominent families but also their sophisticated tastes and
                  aspirations to display power and status through material
                  possessions. Among the most striking features of the estate
                  are the numerous luxury goods, including fine textiles,
                  porcelains, and other exquisite imports from Asia, acquired
                  through the thriving transpacific trade via the Manila
                  Galleon.

                  The Torre Tagle reception room followed the tradition of
                  showcasing Asian furniture. Its inventory lists an “antique

                  Notably, only one of this pair remained in the reception room
                  (the other was likely relocated to the bedroom later).
                  Typically, such matched pairs were placed symmetrically,
                  especially for high-value items meant to highlight the owner’s
                  wealth. This pair of black lacquer Chinese cabinets, adorned
                  with metal plates and handles, was appraised at 500 pesos,
                  making them the most valuable furniture in the entire house.

                <p>
                  The estrado of the marchioness of Torre Tagle included several
                  notable Asian furnishings and objects.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-02rivas-essay-fn57" id="page-02rivas-essay-fnref57" class="footnote-ref-anchor">57</a></sup>
                  Among them were two small black lacquer Chinese boxes with
                  metal hardware, each displayed on its own wood table, and atop
                  each box rested an antique Chinese jar “painted” (enameled) in
                  blue. Additionally, there was a small box inlaid with
                  mother-of-pearl, tortoiseshell, and ivory, though its origin
                  is unspecified. The <em>rodaestrado</em> (estrado hanging) of
                  antique green damask to match the curtains that adorned the
                  doors leading to the sleeping quarters and the reception room
                  may also have been Chinese, but their origin is not specified.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As tradition mandated, the main estrado was followed by the
                  bedroom.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-02rivas-essay-fn58" id="page-02rivas-essay-fnref58" class="footnote-ref-anchor">58</a></sup>
                  While the marchioness of Torre Tagle’s bed hangings were
                  crafted from the locally produced
                  <em>macana de Quito</em> fabric, her bedroom featured numerous
                  Asian imports. For example, beside her bed, she had an
                  additional smaller, more intimate estrado area (which was
                  customary among aristocrats) with an assortment of pieces,
                  including an antique black lacquer Chinese tray table. In the
                  same room, the inventory lists a flask case containing ten
                  Chinese porcelain flasks, an antique red lacquer Chinese box
                  embellished with metal fittings, and an antique black lacquer
                  cabinet from China adorned with metal plates and handles—a
                  matching piece to the one in her reception room. A small
                  antique Chinese porcelain jar sat atop this desk, completing a
                  richly layered display highlighting her appreciation for Asian
                  artistry.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The marchioness of Torre Tagle stored and displayed her
                  porcelain table service, crystal, and other luxury goods in a
                  luxurious cedar cabinet of “antique workmanship,” adorned with
                  silver hardware and plaques.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-02rivas-essay-fn59" id="page-02rivas-essay-fnref59" class="footnote-ref-anchor">59</a></sup>
                  This cabinet, along with three substantial mahogany chests,
                  was situated in an antechamber (<em>antecuadra</em>) adjacent
                  to the master bedroom, emphasizing both the aesthetic and
                  functional importance of her tableware collection.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Inside the cabinet, a considerable array of blue-and-white
                  Chinese porcelain was presented. This collection included a
                  variety of saucers, platters in different sizes and shapes,
                  chocolate cups, salt cellars, lidded cups, gravy boats, and
                  figurines of dogs and lions. This porcelain table service was
                  further complemented by an extensive set of locally crafted
                  silver tableware stored in one of the large mahogany chests.
                  Among the other Asian “treasures” displayed in the luxurious
                  cabinet alongside the Chinese porcelain listed above was an
                  ivory image of the Virgin Mary, two small ivory candlesticks,
                  a black wooden tray from China, and another small round one of
                  enameled metal.

                <p>
                  This limited sample offers a revealing glimpse into the
                  prominence of imported Asian goods within viceregal material
                  culture. While it does not constitute an exhaustive study—such
                  an undertaking would require a far broader selection—this
                  focused analysis, spanning approximately a century, sheds
                  light on the luxury objects present in the homes of the
                  viceregal elite and their specific functions. Moreover, it
                  underscores a notable contrast between New Spain and Peru:
                  Households in New Spain contained significantly more Asian
                  items than their Peruvian counterparts. This disparity is
                  further corroborated by numerous other inventories examined
                  over years of research. The most plausible explanation lies in
                  New Spain’s privileged access to Asian markets via the
                  Manila–Acapulco Galleon trade, which facilitated a steady
                  influx of Asian goods at a lower cost and with greater
                  convenience compared to other parts of Spanish America.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In any case, the widespread presence of imported Asian objects
                  in the residences of the colonial elite attests to their
                  integral role in viceregal material culture. Beyond their
                  practical uses, these objects functioned as markers of luxury,
                  economic power, and refined taste, reinforcing social status
                  and cultural aspirations. Their enduring appeal over more than
                  a century of daily life in Latin America speaks to the deep
                  entanglement of global trade networks with local expressions
                  of wealth and prestige, shaping the visual and material
                  landscapes of the Spanish American viceroyalties.

                  Historians have primarily framed the global networks centered
                  between Asia and the Americas during the early modern era as a
                  “silk for silver” commodity exchange. For centuries, silk was
                  one of the primary luxury goods exported from China to Manila
                  and exchanged there for silver extracted from the
                  astonishingly rich caches at Potosí, in what is today Bolivia.
                  This microhistory of a large set of Catholic church vestments
                  made from Chinese silk explores global circulation during the
                  late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries through an
                  object-focused study of one component of that vast exchange
                  (figs. 1, 2, and 10).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-05corrigan-essay-fn1" id="page-05corrigan-essay-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>

                  focused way to better understand Habsburg Spain’s connections

                  This set of vestments, composed of ten separate elements, was
                  made from a bolt of silk woven in China at some point in the
                  sixteenth or seventeenth centuries (likely between 1580 and
                  1640). The set currently includes two dalmatics (a long
                  priest’s tunic with broad, open sleeves), each with an
                  accompanying collar, a chasuble (a priest’s armless tunic), a
                  stole (a textile band worn around the neck), two maniples (a
                  shorter band worn on the left arm during Mass), a baldachin,
                  and a fragment of unlined cut silk.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-05corrigan-essay-fn2" id="page-05corrigan-essay-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                  A chalice veil to cover the communion cup likely originally
                  accompanied the other textiles, but given its small size, it
                  is not surprising that the veil has not survived with the set.
                  A private collector acquired the set in the 1920s from a small
                  church in northern Spain, possibly Séron de Nágima in the
                  province of Soria. Galerie Ruf, a textile dealer in
                  Beckenried, Switzerland, purchased the group of vestments in
                  the 1980s from the son of the collector and, finally, the
                  Peabody Essex Museum (PEM) acquired the set from the gallery
                  in 2001. This is all that we currently know about the set from
                  the archival record, but there are other avenues to unpack the
                  set’s more than four-hundred-year history. A close analysis of
                  the objects themselves can build an informative and
                  interconnected narrative of the set’s long journey from China
                  to Spain and its connection to a larger global history.

                  Chinese silks were first introduced to the Iberian world via
                  the land-based trade networks connecting Asia with the Middle
                  East. Spanish weavers began incorporating Chinese motifs in
                  their designs as early as the 1300s.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-05corrigan-essay-fn3" id="page-05corrigan-essay-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                  But the quantities of Chinese silk that physically arrived in
                  Europe were initially quite limited. More than one thousand
                  patterned silks dating from the seventh to twelfth centuries
                  are preserved in European church treasuries, but only one
                  example is plausibly from China.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-05corrigan-essay-fn4" id="page-05corrigan-essay-fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                  The initial stylistic impact of Chinese silks in Europe was
                  likely more indirect. European weavers could have adapted
                  their designs from imported Persian and other Central Asian
                  textiles that had been, in turn, influenced by Chinese
                  textiles.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ocean-based trade dramatically changed the volume of
                  Europeans’ direct contact with Chinese silks, at least at the
                  edges of the Spanish Crown’s empire. In 1594, García Hurtado
                  de Mendoza, fourth marquis of Cañete and viceroy of Peru,
                  noted that in the viceroyalties, “Chinese merchandise is so
                  cheap and Spanish goods so dear . . . a man can clothe his
                  wife in Chinese silks for two hundred reales, whereas he could
                  not provide her with clothing of Spanish silks with two
                  hundred pesos.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-05corrigan-essay-fn5" id="page-05corrigan-essay-fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>
                  The Spanish Crown initially banned the importation of Chinese
                  silks to the viceroyalties in an attempt to protect the
                  Spanish textile industries’ new markets in the Americas. These
                  edicts from the Crown were repeated (and often ignored)
                  throughout the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth
                  centuries. In 1718, after the latest ban was implemented,
                  Baltasar de Zúñiga, viceroy of New Spain, refused to implement
                  it, noting that residents in Mexico preferred the Chinese
                  imports and their relative affordability.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-05corrigan-essay-fn6" id="page-05corrigan-essay-fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>

                  Silk was imported from China in a variety of forms and levels
                  of quality—raw and floss silk, threads, dyed and undyed bolts
                  of cloth, and woven, embroidered, and painted silks. In
                  <em>Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas</em> (1609), Antonio de
                  Morga, a former lieutenant governor of the Philippines,
                  described the various kinds of Chinese silk imported into
                  Manila:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    Raw silk, in bundles, of the fineness of two strands, and
                    other silk of inferior quality; fine untwisted silks, white
                    and of all colours, in small skeins; quantities of smooth
                    velvets, and velvet embroidered in all sorts of patterns,
                    colours and fashions; and others, with the ground of gold
                    and embroidered with the same; woven cloths and brocades of
                    gold and silver upon silk of various colours and patterns,
                    quantities of gold and silver thread in skeins, upon thread
                    and upon silk, but all the spangles of gold and silver are
                    false and upon paper; damask, satins, taffetas, and
                    gorvarans (<em>sic</em>), picotes (<em>sic</em>), and others
                    cloths of all colours, some finer and better than
                    others.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-05corrigan-essay-fn7" id="page-05corrigan-essay-fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>

                  Elite households in the Americas utilized imported Asian silks
                  for domestic furnishing textiles as well as for personal
                  clothing.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-05corrigan-essay-fn8" id="page-05corrigan-essay-fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>
                  But the Catholic Church was also a voracious consumer of
                  imported Asian textiles for liturgical vestments and altar
                  coverings. The earliest documented use of Chinese textiles for
                  religious purposes in the Iberian world is in the 1521
                  inventory for King Manuel I of Portugal, who owned a vestment
                  made of Chinese brocaded silk.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-05corrigan-essay-fn9" id="page-05corrigan-essay-fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>
                  Archival records from the late sixteenth and seventeenth
                  centuries document numerous examples of vestments constructed
                  of Chinese silk and intended for churches in the viceroyalties
                  and throughout Spain and Portugal. Pedro Martínez Buytrón, a
                  priest who died in Mexico City in 1596, had a large collection
                  of Chinese export silk vestments in his possession. Buytrón’s
                  estate inventory included a set of purple taffeta garments
                  with a chasuble, a stole, and a maniple. Buytrón also owned a
                  second set of vestments made of black damask silk with yellow

                  Priests in the viceroyalties seemed to have been early
                  adopters of vestments made from Chinese silk, but the fashion
                  extended to Spain. In 1616, <em>don</em> Diego Vásquez de
                  Mercado, archbishop of Manila, sent his nephew don Pedro de
                  Mercado Vásquez, a <em>regidor</em> (alderman) of Madrid, a
                  set of Chinese silk church vestments that included dalmatics,
                  a chasuble, and a stole.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-05corrigan-essay-fn11" id="page-05corrigan-essay-fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup>
                  Smaller Spanish villages also frequently received gifts from
                  Asia as tribute or bequests from locals who had emigrated to
                  the viceroyalties. Javier Pescador’s microhistory of a Basque
                  region in northern Spain outlines the sustained donations of
                  Asian goods from expatriates throughout the seventeenth and
                  eighteenth centuries to small parishes (and family members) in
                  the region.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-05corrigan-essay-fn12" id="page-05corrigan-essay-fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup>

                  The earliest documented and surviving set of Chinese export
                  silk vestments is preserved in Portugal. The set was ordered
                  in Macau in 1634 by a “very rich and honored Chinese mandarin
                  esteemed for his virtue,” named Francisco Carvalho Aranha, and
                  sent to the brotherhood of Bom Jesus de São Marcos at the
                  church of Santa Cruz (Braga).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-05corrigan-essay-fn13" id="page-05corrigan-essay-fnref13" class="footnote-ref-anchor">13</a></sup>
                  The set included two chasubles, two dalmatics, and a cope (a
                  priest’s wide cape) as well as three altar frontals, a cross
                  cover, a pulpit fall, and a baldachin. Each of the components
                  in the set, made of cream satin silk and crimson velvet silk,
                  was elaborately embroidered with gold and silver thread in a
                  stylized pattern of intertwining vines. Some of the components
                  also incorporate the symbol of the brotherhood. Likely guided
                  by the patron, the tailors and embroiderers who assembled the
                  set in China worked with a clear understanding of the desired
                  forms and ornamentation of these European-style religious
                  textiles.
                </p>

                  Unlike Aranha’s fully assembled gift to the brotherhood of Bom
                  Jesus, the set on which this study is based was assembled in
                  Spain using a bolt of imported Chinese silk.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-05corrigan-essay-fn14" id="page-05corrigan-essay-fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup>
                  Antonio de Morga’s description of “brocades of gold and silver
                  upon silk of various colours and patterns” best describes this
                  long and sumptuous bolt. Woven in China in the late sixteenth
                  or early seventeenth century, this textile has a complicated
                  weave structure and would have been an exceptionally expensive
                  silk when first commissioned and produced.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-05corrigan-essay-fn15" id="page-05corrigan-essay-fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup>

                  All woven textiles are composed of warp and weft threads. Warp
                  threads run vertically and are the fixed threads that attach
                  to a loom during weaving. Weft threads cross over and under
                  the warps in different configurations to create a woven
                  textile. Compound textiles such as this example are created on
                  large and complex drawlooms with multiple shafts manipulated
                  by the weavers. Composed of a crimson red silk satin warp with
                  wefts in blue, green, and white silk, the weaver has augmented
                  the design with discontinuous supplementary gilded paper wefts
                  brocaded into the textile (fig. 3). Unlike the woven elements
                  of the design, the black eyes of the lions dispersed
                  throughout the design are painted onto the textile.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The creators of this Chinese brocaded silk wove a pattern with
                  a 28½ inch repeat that features a pair of guardian or rampant
                  lions among scrolling foliage and surmounted by a European
                  crown. This striking combination of motifs is derived from
                  Chinese domestic textiles and European—likely Spanish or
                  Italian—silks imported into China. The guardian lions that
                  dominate the design bear a close resemblance to those found on
                  textiles made for Chinese officials, such as a tapestry woven
                  rank badge from the fifteenth century (fig. 4).

                  As early as the fourteenth century, Chinese imperial decrees
                  outlined sumptuary laws for officials of various ranks. To
                  identify their rank, Chinese civil and military officials wore
                  woven or embroidered badges on the front and back of their
                  robes. Within the elaborate hierarchies of power in late Ming
                  imperial China, there were more than twenty different kinds of
                  badges decorated with animals to identify an official’s rank.
                  First and second rank military officials typically wore a
                  badge ornamented with a lion.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-05corrigan-essay-fn16" id="page-05corrigan-essay-fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup>
                  The lions in both the rank badge and the bolt of cloth feature
                  wide eyes, open toothy grins, and bushy green tails typical of
                  those found on Chinese textiles from the late Ming dynasty.
                  While the rank badge features only one lion, the silk bolt
                  features pairs of guardian lions chasing a brocaded ball, a
                  familiar motif in Chinese iconography that was often regarded
                  as a symbol of happiness (fig. 5).

                  The charming creatures on the silk bolt are not an exclusively
                  Chinese element—they also recall rampant lions, a symbol of
                  nobility in European heraldry. The Chinese weavers may have
                  used Spanish and Italian lampas silks imported to China in the
                  sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as design sources for
                  these rampant lions. A fifteenth-century Spanish lampas silk
                  features a pair of crowned and confronting lions in the midst
                  of scrolling foliage (fig. 6). The undulating plant forms and
                  whimsical animals within this design relate to earlier
                  textiles produced in Spain under the Nasrid dynasty, who ruled
                  the Iberian Peninsula prior to the Christian conquest in 1492.
                  Fragments of silk in this design are preserved in multiple
                  public collections, including at least one that was formerly
                  part of a chasuble.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-05corrigan-essay-fn17" id="page-05corrigan-essay-fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup>
                  The design of a late-sixteenth- or early-seventeenth-century
                  Italian or Spanish silk bears an even closer relationship to
                  the Chinese silk bolt (fig. 7).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-05corrigan-essay-fn18" id="page-05corrigan-essay-fnref18" class="footnote-ref-anchor">18</a></sup>
                  These fragments are examples of the kinds of European textiles
                  that could have been sent to China to serve as design sources
                  for the Chinese weavers.

                  The Chinese silk’s design repeat also includes a large and
                  distinctly European crown floating above the heads of the
                  guardian lions. The pointed crown, primarily composed of
                  gilded paper, has a brim with a crosshatched pattern in green,
                  blue, and gold and is augmented with two round green jewels
                  encircled in blue. The scrolling vines undulating throughout
                  the background are interspersed with three different types of
                  flowers—one type is likely a chrysanthemum, a motif found
                  frequently on Chinese damask silks made for the domestic
                  market (fig. 8).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-05corrigan-essay-fn19" id="page-05corrigan-essay-fnref19" class="footnote-ref-anchor">19</a></sup>
                  All of these textile designs highlight how weavers in multiple
                  locations around the globe were part of a robust international
                  exchange of design motifs that spanned centuries.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-05corrigan-essay-fn20" id="page-05corrigan-essay-fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup>

                <p>
                  The combination of Asian and European motifs incorporated into
                  the pattern for the PEM silk helps identify it as Chinese, but
                  there are other distinguishing features that support a Chinese
                  attribution. One of the most reliable ways to identify a
                  Chinese textile—particularly a simple weave without a design
                  or further embellishment—is the width of the textile.
                  Selvage-to-selvage widths of Chinese silks are typically much
                  wider than their European counterparts (26 to 31 inches wide
                  vs. 19½ to 23 inches wide).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-05corrigan-essay-fn21" id="page-05corrigan-essay-fnref21" class="footnote-ref-anchor">21</a></sup>
                  Many Chinese silks also have selvages woven in a contrasting
                  color. Yet another distinguishing feature of many Chinese
                  silks is the presence of sequential holes in the selvages.
                  These holes are evidence of a pair of crossed rods—sometimes
                  called temple rods—used by weavers to help maintain a
                  symmetrical fabric width during weaving. Chinese silks also
                  have a soft, clinging “hand” that is the result of mechanical
                  calendering.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-05corrigan-essay-fn22" id="page-05corrigan-essay-fnref22" class="footnote-ref-anchor">22</a></sup>
                  The selvage-to-selvage width of the bolt of silk used to
                  create PEM’s set of vestments is approximately 28 inches. The
                  selvage edges—only visible now on the surviving unlined silk
                  fragment—are white. Also visible on the fragment, just inside
                  the selvage edge, is a thin continuous line of yellow satin
                  weave silk. Occasionally visible at the seams of different
                  components of the set, these yellow silk lines presumably
                  framed the edges of the fabric and would have aided tailors in
                  matching up seams.

                  Early Chinese silks incorporating European motifs have
                  traditionally been attributed to weavers in Macau. This is
                  likely based on the assumption that the weavers would have
                  needed direct contact with foreign agents to produce textiles
                  incorporating European motifs, but there is limited evidence
                  that Macau was an early center for silk weaving in China.
                  Export ceramic production in the sixteenth and seventeenth
                  centuries can serve as a useful model for speculating on other
                  plausible locations for the production of these early export
                  silks. Potters in Jingdezhen during the late Ming dynasty
                  successfully produced and exported customized ceramics
                  incorporating global motifs despite being more than three
                  hundred miles from the Chinese coastline. Using this
                  customized porcelain production as a model, could these early
                  export silks have been woven in one of a variety of silk
                  production centers in southern China? Suzhou and Hangzhou
                  produced high-quality silk for imperial and regional use
                  during the late Ming dynasty, and Guangdong and Fujian
                  provinces were also major silk production centers. Given that
                  Hokkien merchants controlled the early Chinese junk trade from
                  Fujian to Manila, perhaps the coastal cities of Fuzhou and
                  Quanzhou could be plausible production centers for the complex
                  silks exported to the Philippines during the sixteenth and
                  seventeenth centuries. Quanzhou, in particular, was known
                  during the Ming dynasty for pattern weave silks and silks
                  incorporating gold and silk thread.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-05corrigan-essay-fn23" id="page-05corrigan-essay-fnref23" class="footnote-ref-anchor">23</a></sup>
                  We can perhaps begin to test this assumption by conducting
                  analysis of dyestuffs and other materials used in these
                  textiles and reviewing their weave structures.

                  Xian Zhang from History Echoes Analytical Services is an
                  analytical chemist with experience in natural dyestuffs, who
                  studied several samples from the unlined fragment in PEM’s
                  set. Her testing provides analytical information on the silk
                  and reinforces the assertion that the textile was made in
                  China. The crimson red silk that dominates the textile was
                  dyed with lac, a traditional dye source used throughout Asia
                  that is derived from the lac insect.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-05corrigan-essay-fn24" id="page-05corrigan-essay-fnref24" class="footnote-ref-anchor">24</a></sup>
                  The green silk used for the bushy tails of the lions and as a
                  border for some of the motifs was dyed with indigo (blue) and
                  pagoda tree buds (yellow). Pagoda trees (<em>Styphnolobium japonicum</em>) are native to central and northern China and Korea. The
                  gilded strips selectively added throughout the textile are
                  composed of a thin sheet of gold foil attached with a mixture
                  of animal glue, kaolin clay, and laterite to a compound paper
                  substrate. The foil layer is composed of 70 percent gold, 17
                  percent silver, and other minor elements, an alloy that is
                  consistent with Chinese gold foil samples found on ancient
                  textiles.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-05corrigan-essay-fn25" id="page-05corrigan-essay-fnref25" class="footnote-ref-anchor">25</a></sup>
                  Despite what Antonio de Morga wrote about these kinds of
                  textiles in 1609, not “all the spangles of gold and silver are
                  <strong>false</strong> and upon paper.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-05corrigan-essay-fn26" id="page-05corrigan-essay-fnref26" class="footnote-ref-anchor">26</a></sup>

                  Weavers have been incorporating paper covered in gold foil
                  into Chinese textiles for more than two thousand years.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-05corrigan-essay-fn27" id="page-05corrigan-essay-fnref27" class="footnote-ref-anchor">27</a></sup>
                  An English visitor to Hong Kong in the 1870s watched gold foil
                  being produced while touring an alley near the street for silk
                  embroiderers. He noted:

                    covered either with gold, or silver leaf. In order that a

                  Once woven, this sumptuous bolt of lightweight, supple, and
                  vibrantly colored silk would have been carefully packed and
                  shipped from southern China to Manila. Beginning in the 1570s,
                  Hokkien merchants from Fujian dominated the Chinese junk trade
                  in Southeast and East Asia. Junks traveled from ports along
                  the Fujian coastline—Quanzhou and Xiamen—as well as from
                  Guangzhou and Macao—on vessels that typically weighed 350 tons
                  and carried a crew of between two and four hundred men. Some
                  of the largest had crews of close to five hundred.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-05corrigan-essay-fn29" id="page-05corrigan-essay-fnref29" class="footnote-ref-anchor">29</a></sup>
                  The journey from China to Manila typically took between
                  fifteen and twenty days.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1589, eighty-eight Chinese junks were licensed for
                  international maritime trade. By 1597, the licensed junks had
                  increased to 137. Roughly half of those Chinese vessels were
                  engaged with direct trade between Fujian and Manila.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-05corrigan-essay-fn30" id="page-05corrigan-essay-fnref30" class="footnote-ref-anchor">30</a></sup>
                  Smuggling was rampant, so it is difficult to pinpoint the
                  precise numbers of junks trading with the Philippines, but it
                  is estimated that between twenty and forty junks visited
                  Manila annually between the late 1570s and the early 1640s.
                  Silk made up the bulk of their cargoes, which the Hokkien
                  merchants sold for as much South American silver as they could
                  acquire, annually sending as much as 150 tons of silver back
                  to China. Jerónimo de Salazar y Salcedo reported to the king
                  in 1599 that the profits to be made on imported Chinese silk
                  were as high as 400 percent.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-05corrigan-essay-fn31" id="page-05corrigan-essay-fnref31" class="footnote-ref-anchor">31</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Hokkien merchants also resided long-term in Manila and ran the
                  hundreds of retail shops in the Parián market just outside the
                  walls of the city. But unlike the many Chinese silks offered
                  in the market, this sumptuous bolt was likely a special
                  commission and would not have been offered for retail sale.
                  Chinese textile merchants were particularly skilled at folding
                  and rolling textiles to the specifications of buyers to
                  maximize the quantities of silk that could be packed. Once
                  loaded into the hold of a galleon for the long journey across
                  the Pacific Ocean from Manila to Acapulco, this special
                  commission would have been transshipped across Mexico to
                  Veracruz for reshipment and delivery in Seville. This bolt was
                  likely commissioned for a high-ranking priest—either as a
                  special commission he made for himself or as a gift from a
                  colleague or family member. When a canon was appointed and
                  received his prebend—the portion of the cathedral’s revenue
                  allotted to a senior member of the church—it was typical for
                  him to order a new set of vestments. At the cathedral in
                  Huesca, Spain, for example, it was required that a newly
                  appointed bishop present a chasuble, tunic, tunicle, two
                  dalmatics, and three copes to the cathedral within three years
                  of his appointment. These vestments often reverted to a
                  cathedral’s collection upon a bishop’s death, a practice that
                  accounts for the diversity of splendid textiles preserved
                  within Spanish church treasuries to this day.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-05corrigan-essay-fn32" id="page-05corrigan-essay-fnref32" class="footnote-ref-anchor">32</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Spanish tailors who created this set of vestments lavishly
                  used the imported silk bolt on the most significant and
                  visible components of the set—the underside of the baldachin
                  and the backs of the dalmatics and chasuble. But they also
                  ensured the maximum use of this precious textile by thriftily
                  piecing together small fragments of the silk to create the
                  maniples and stole. The tailors also incorporated locally made
                  textiles for both decorative and functional purposes when
                  stitching the components together. Each piece is decoratively
                  augmented with Spanish tape woven in red, white, and blue
                  cotton (fig. 9). European tailors typically used this type of
                  tape to reinforce and cover the seams of the narrow widths of
                  European silks used on many church vestments. Given the wider
                  width of Chinese silk, the tape on the PEM vestments is used
                  more decoratively, often stitched on top of a single length of
                  silk, rather than necessarily covering a seam.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-05corrigan-essay-fn33" id="page-05corrigan-essay-fnref33" class="footnote-ref-anchor">33</a></sup>
                  Various elements of the set were also lined with European
                  linen to provide support for the especially thin and supple
                  Chinese silk.

                  The baldachin is perhaps the most unusual component of the set
                  to survive (fig 10). Baldachins are architectural canopies
                  that mark and enclose a space in a religious, civic, or
                  domestic environment. As noted in Rivas’s essay in this
                  volume, textile canopies were sometimes hung above a throne or
                  chair in the palaces and homes of the elite. The 1729
                  inventory of Carlos Bermúdez de Castro, archbishop of Manila,
                  included a baldachin, which he used to display artworks.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-05corrigan-essay-fn34" id="page-05corrigan-essay-fnref34" class="footnote-ref-anchor">34</a></sup>
                  Baldachins used religiously typically hang above an altar or
                  devotional image, suspended from above or supported on slender
                  columns. Encountered on its own, this baldachin could have
                  been made for either a domestic or religious setting, but its
                  survival with accompanying religious garments made from the
                  same Chinese silk indicates that it was likely designed to be
                  used religiously.

                  but not the back, indicating that the baldachin was likely
                  suspended over an altarpiece against a wall.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-05corrigan-essay-fn35" id="page-05corrigan-essay-fnref35" class="footnote-ref-anchor">35</a></sup>
                  Iron rings stitched to the front corners of the baldachin once
                  accommodated chains to suspend the canopy from the ceiling.
                  Chinese silk fully lines the underside of the canopy roof so
                  that during prayer or a service, a viewer gazed up at the
                  glittering lengths of the silk’s beautiful design. The
                  baldachin’s sixty-inch depth is greater than two widths of the
                  Chinese silk, so the tailors carefully stitched a narrow
                  length of the same silk between the two full widths that run
                  from proper left to right underneath the canopy.

                  The narrow panels that hang from the canopy also feature
                  sections of silk on the exterior, but the tailors economized
                  by using a Chinese plain weave blue silk on the inside of the
                  hanging panels. When the Peabody Essex Museum acquired the
                  set, this blue silk lining survived only as fragmentary
                  evidence, revealing that the tailors had sandwiched a
                  stabilizing linen lining between the brocaded and blue silks
                  for greater structure (fig. 11). When the canopy was
                  originally in use, the lining would never have been visible.
                  An inscription in ink preserved on the lining—“48 de M<sup>a</sup>
                  Fr<sup>s</sup> en el pasatienpo”—offers an enigmatic but
                  tantalizing clue to the set’s provenance (fig. 12). The “48”
                  is possibly an inventory number for the church’s collection of
                  vestments. Since M<sup>a</sup> is typically shorthand for
                  Maria, and Fr<sup>s</sup> could be an abbreviation for
                  Francisca, could this inscription document the participation
                  of a female donor or seamstress in the creation of the
                  set?<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-05corrigan-essay-fn36" id="page-05corrigan-essay-fnref36" class="footnote-ref-anchor">36</a></sup>

                  The linen lining has an additional secret. While the front and
                  proper right side panels were lined with lengths of plain
                  linen, the tailors frugally recycled two different kinds of
                  European block printed linen to line the proper left side
                  panel (figs. 13 and 14).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-05corrigan-essay-fn37" id="page-05corrigan-essay-fnref37" class="footnote-ref-anchor">37</a></sup>
                  Printed with a mordant dye using madder root, the simple
                  designs on these recycled panels were inspired by more
                  sophisticated imported Indian cottons (fig. 15).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-05corrigan-essay-fn38" id="page-05corrigan-essay-fnref38" class="footnote-ref-anchor">38</a></sup>
                  Hiding in plain sight, these humble (and now rare) European
                  linen fragments are another tangible link to the global
                  network of exchange in textiles during this period.

                  Sets of vestments all made from the same fabric created a
                  cohesive ensemble for feast days. The deep crimson red of the
                  silk used for this set of vestments may indicate that it was
                  used for a specific feast day or perhaps even during Holy
                  Week, leading up to the celebration of Easter. The satin weave
                  of the silk and the gilded paper floats would have undoubtedly

                  Preserved as a set for over four centuries, this rare group of

                  and Spain and the power and wealth of the Catholic Church in

                        See Rivas’s essay in this volume for details on some
                        domestic consumption. Chinese silks dominated the market
                        in the viceroyalties, but elites also combined
                        Castilian, Italian, and even locally produced silks into
                        their households and wardrobes. For more on those

                        Prior to the baldachin’s installation in the Sean M.
                        Healey Gallery of Asian Export Art in 2019, textile
                        conservator Deirdre Windsor developed an innovative
                        framework to safely suspend and display it in the
                        gallery. During the preparatory conservation, PEM opted
                        to replicate the original blue silk lining on the side
                        panels, which now obscures the linen lining including
                        the block printed European linen fragments. Unlike the
                        recycled fragments, the plain linen and tape used to
                        line the other sides and the top of the canopy were
                        likely new when the baldachin was first assembled.

                  In 1830, Captain Joseph Jenkins Knapp Jr. (1803–1830) donated
                  a square piece of Philippine <em>piña</em> cloth to the East
                  India Marine Society Museum, one of the originating
                  collections of the current Peabody Essex Museum in Salem,
                  Massachusetts (fig. 1).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-09lua-essay-fn1" id="page-09lua-essay-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                  Piña cloth is fabric woven out of the finest fibers of
                  pineapple leaves, creating a soft, sheer, and fine material
                  like that of a cotton muslin. A description written directly
                  on this fabric makes note of this material knowledge and
                  leaves a trace of the cloth’s collection history. Though now
                  significantly faded, it reads: “4182 / Made of the fibers of
                  the Pine Apple at Manilla [sic] by the natives” (fig. 2).
                  Rather than an imported good brought back for consumers in the
                  United States, this cloth was categorized under what the
                  Society bylaws termed “articles of curiosity.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-09lua-essay-fn2" id="page-09lua-essay-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                  This language was specific to the Society’s mission to build a
                  scientific collection, in which it charged captains and
                  supercargoes to bring back objects from their travels overseas
                  for the Society’s museum. Applied here, the cloth was
                  designated for building scientific knowledge through early
                  museum practice in the US.

                  Compared to other objects acquired by the East India Marine
                  Society Museum, Knapp’s piña cloth was unusual. Some merchants
                  at the time did not know the original use and function of the
                  items that they collected. For them and for the viewers who
                  would later see these items on display, the various objects
                  were merely viewed as representations of their respective
                  cultures or of the exchanges that had taken place
                  overseas.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-09lua-essay-fn3" id="page-09lua-essay-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                  However, Captain J. J. Knapp was knowledgeable about his
                  cloth, particularly when it came to the fabric’s composition.
                  While seemingly a minute detail—especially given the
                  ghost-like remnants of the cloth’s description—Knapp’s correct
                  identification of the fabric’s pineapple leaf material is rare
                  and exceptional. Due to its material similarity to silk, fine
                  cotton, and linen, piña has often eluded consumers and museum
                  practitioners both then and now.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-09lua-essay-fn4" id="page-09lua-essay-fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                  Furthermore, while some items in the museum’s founding
                  collection were removed from their original ritual or
                  spiritual environments, because piña did not have a ceremonial
                  function in the Philippines, Knapp’s cloth did not lose any
                  sort of sacred meaning through its acquisition. For the
                  purposes of building the growing collection at the East India
                  Marine Society Museum, Knapp’s knowledge of the cloth was
                  accurate and sufficient.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, as a small piece of cloth now in the United States,
                  Knapp’s piña was cut from a larger physical and cultural
                  fabric that was left unwritten in Knapp’s description, one
                  that wove together the fabric’s craft and sartorial
                  significance in the Philippines. In the archipelago, the cloth
                  would have moved between the hands of makers and consumers
                  across multiple islands. The first step of production took
                  place on the island of Panay, where artisans worked to
                  extract, process, hand-knot, and weave pineapple leaf fibers.
                  The woven fabric would then travel north to Manila, the
                  present-day capital of the Philippines, and its surrounding
                  regions, where <em>bordadoras</em> (embroiderers) and
                  <em>costureras</em> (seamstresses) decorated and fashioned the
                  cloth into outfits such as the men’s
                  <em>barong tagalog</em> and women’s <em>baro’t saya</em>. As
                  one of the finest fabrics used in these traditional garments,
                  piña clothed the elite echelons of Manila society. The
                  fabric’s translucence and intricate embroidery came to
                  symbolize wealth and a cosmopolitanism that was affordable to
                  only a few. Cut from this cultural fabric, Knapp’s cloth
                  captured both this interisland manufacture as well as the
                  material’s meaning within Philippine fashion.

                <p>
                  Reading Knapp’s description and beyond it, this essay unpacks
                  not only the dynamic world of Philippine piña craft and
                  fashion but also the fabric’s inclusion within the founding
                  collection of the East Indian Marine Society Museum. As a
                  textile fragment, the cloth’s very pineapple leaf material
                  remains as an archive of its weaving methods and sartorial
                  culture in the Philippines during the early nineteenth
                  century. At the same time, the fragment is evidence of its
                  significance as an object for scientific inquiry within the
                  East India Marine Society Museum collection, a project that
                  simultaneously projected a global citizenship for a young
                  nation like the United States. Having arrived in the US a
                  decade after the last galleon sailed the Manila–Acapulco
                  trade, this example of piña at the present-day Peabody Essex
                  Museum highlights a new facet of these transpacific crossings.
                  While the Manila Galleon trade might have ended, transpacific
                  exchange continued in new ways with new actors. For Salem,
                  this exchange contributed to a cross-cultural intersection
                  where art, trade, and scientific exploration contributed to
                  early American museum practice at the East Indian Marine
                  Society Museum.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-09lua-essay-fn5" id="page-09lua-essay-fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>

                <p>
                  <strong>Nineteenth-Century Philippine Piña Craft and
                    Fashion</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Though now a plain-woven, square-cut piece of cloth, Knapp’s
                  piña fabric had once lived in the vibrant world of piña craft
                  and fashion in the Philippines. Far from the static display at
                  the East India Marine Society Museum, Knapp’s cloth embodies a
                  larger and more dynamic context within the textile tradition
                  and cosmopolitan culture of the Philippines during the
                  nineteenth century.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Yet, this dynamic context of piña fabric begins not in the
                  Philippines but in South America. Before discussing piña craft
                  and fashion, it is important to note that the pineapple plant
                  itself is not native to the Philippines. The exact origin
                  story of how the pineapple arrived in the Philippines is
                  shrouded in myth, but most scholars believe that Ferdinand
                  Magellan’s voyages brought the fruit from South America and
                  introduced it to Philippine soil shortly after landing in the
                  Visayan region in 1521.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-09lua-essay-fn6" id="page-09lua-essay-fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>
                  As pineapples proliferated in he tropical Philippine
                  landscape, weavers adapted the techniques of creating native
                  banana leaf fabric, or <em>abaca</em>, to producing woven
                  cloth with this new pineapple leaf material. In particular,
                  makers used the method of hand-knotting abaca fibers to make
                  thread for producing piña thread as well.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-09lua-essay-fn7" id="page-09lua-essay-fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>
                  By the early nineteenth century, Spanish friar and botanist
                  Manuel Blanco noted this weaving tradition in his botanical
                  text <em>Flora de Filipinas</em> (1837), which is still
                  considered a foundational treatise for Philippine botany. In
                  his entry on the <em>Bromelia ananas</em> species, he recorded
                  that the Native <em>indios</em> made shirts of remarkable
                  delicacy with the fine threads drawn from pineapple
                  leaves.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-09lua-essay-fn8" id="page-09lua-essay-fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>
                  Measuring the visual impact of the transpacific crossing of
                  piña requires considering first the transpacific crossing of
                  the pineapple. Even for a cloth closely associated with
                  Filipino culture, Knapp’s fabric must be understood as a
                  product of not just one transpacific crossing but two: the
                  first from South America to the Philippines and the second
                  from the Philippines to the United States.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although Knapp had written “Manilla” on his fabric, piña
                  production took place and continues to take place on Panay
                  Island, located south of Manila on the western side of the
                  Visayan region. When weavers created Knapp’s cloth during the
                  nineteenth century, centers for piña manufacture existed in
                  Iloilo, a province located in southeast Panay.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-09lua-essay-fn9" id="page-09lua-essay-fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>
                  Today, piña is largely woven in the northern portion of the
                  island in the province of Aklan, where the technique remains a
                  cottage industry traditionally practiced by women. While there
                  have been a few technological changes in tools involved in the
                  craft, much of scholars’ and contemporary weavers’ knowledge
                  of historic processes draws from present-day practices.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-09lua-essay-fn10" id="page-09lua-essay-fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The first step in producing Knapp’s piña cloth was harvesting
                  pineapple leaves, which makers then scraped to extract the
                  leaf fiber for the fabric’s thread. The specific pineapple
                  variety used for piña is the Red Spanish pineapple. According
                  to weavers, this pineapple yields stronger fibers than other
                  varieties. The leaves that the artisans harvested came not
                  from the crown of the pineapple but from the bush where the
                  fruit grows. Each leaf measures around a meter long. Once
                  makers gathered the amount of leaves that they planned to
                  scrape for the day, two rounds of leaf scraping ensued to
                  extract two kinds of piña fiber. First, using a sanded-down
                  porcelain plate shard, the leaf-scraper would begin to scrape
                  the epidermis of the pineapple leaf (fig. 3).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-09lua-essay-fn11" id="page-09lua-essay-fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup>
                  The scraper would remove just enough to reveal the first layer
                  of piña fibers, called the washed-out fiber. The maker would
                  extract these fibers by pulling them up and off the leaf by
                  hand.

                  For the second round, the scraper would take a coconut
                  shell—also sanded down—and begin scraping the leaf where she
                  had just extracted the washed-out fiber (fig. 4). Once the
                  leaf was thin enough, the maker would pull the second fiber
                  from the back of the leaf, also by hand. This fiber, called
                  <em>liniwan</em>, was the finer of the two. Today, piña
                  textiles are often made with both the coarser washed-out fiber
                  and the liniwan fiber. However, during the nineteenth century,
                  all piña textiles were made only with the finer liniwan
                  fiber.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-09lua-essay-fn12" id="page-09lua-essay-fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup>
                  Knapp’s piña cloth was most likely woven with liniwan fiber,
                  which is evident in the delicate and translucent materiality
                  of its fabric.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After extracting and cleaning the piña fibers, artisans made
                  piña thread by tying each individual fiber from end to end,
                  resulting in one continuous filament (fig. 5). As previously
                  discussed, piña weavers adapted this technique of
                  hand-knotting fibers from making banana-leaf threads, which
                  were also created by the tying of individual fibers together.
                  Hand-knotting was not limited to preparing piña thread,
                  however. Due to the delicate nature of the fiber, threads
                  often broke as weavers began to prepare the warp or began to
                  weave on the loom. To fix these breakages, the weaver would go
                  back to the broken threads and reconnect the fibers by tying
                  them together. Piña fabrics like Knapp’s cloth display this
                  process of hand-knotting and rehand-knotting. Under
                  magnification, small knots appear throughout the piña fabric,
                  bearing witness to the unique quality of piña thread and the
                  hand-knotting technique necessary to accommodate the fine
                  material (fig. 6). As one can imagine, the process of
                  hand-knotting fibers, both to make and to fix threads,
                  requires great patience and a meticulous hand.

                  Once hand-knotters finished creating piña thread, they
                  supplied it to local weavers. Like most weaving traditions,
                  weaving piña began with preparing the warp threads and weft
                  threads. Preparing piña warp meant calculating the length of
                  warp thread that the weaver needed for the desired length and
                  width of the intended fabric. To calculate these measurements,
                  the artisan would wind the hand-knotted piña thread around a
                  cylindrical warp frame, whose wooden spokes marked different
                  points of measurement to help the weaver keep count of the
                  amount of warp threads she had wound (fig. 7). Preparing piña
                  weft required a different process. Taking the hand-knotted
                  piña, the weaver would use a spindle to wind thread around a
                  bobbin. Afterward, she placed the bobbin into a shuttle, which
                  she would then use for weaving (fig. 8). Once the weaver
                  calculated the warp and dressed the floor loom, she began to
                  weave (fig. 9). Most piña fabrics display a plain-weave
                  structure or variations of a plain-weave structure
                  thereof.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-09lua-essay-fn13" id="page-09lua-essay-fnref13" class="footnote-ref-anchor">13</a></sup>
                  Knapp’s cloth, for instance, displays a plain-weave structure,
                  where one weft thread is woven over one warp thread, resulting
                  in a soft and diaphanous fabric.

                  The woven piña cloth could go to several textile distribution
                  points after its completion. Within the island of Panay,
                  vendors could sell piña along with other textiles at local,
                  open-air marketplaces. Here, vendors ranged from the local
                  weaver who sold her own products to the entrepreneurial
                  <em>sinamayera</em>, or textile vendor, who sold the products
                  of several weavers and embroiderers. Leaving Panay, ships from
                  Manila transported these woven fabrics from the port of Iloilo
                  back to the capital, where sinamayeras in different districts
                  sold the piña cloth. These markets in Manila often drew in
                  textiles from a variety of provinces, where piña was sold
                  alongside textiles from northern provinces like those in the
                  Ilocos region. Furthermore, as it had been during the height
                  of the Manila–Acapulco trade, Manila remained as the
                  archipelago’s main <em>entrepôt</em> through which foreign
                  merchants could access the Philippine market. Rather than
                  describing where the cloth was woven, then, Knapp’s
                  description of “Manilla” points to the location where he, and
                  most foreign consumers, acquired finished piña fabric.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-09lua-essay-fn14" id="page-09lua-essay-fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Knapp had collected his textile as an undecorated fabric, but
                  had the cloth remained in the Philippines, a textile vendor
                  could have taken the full piña yardage to a nearby bordadora
                  for further embellishment. In the hands of the bordadora,
                  plain piña fabric became a canvas for elegant florals, vines,
                  and geometric patterns (fig. 10). Similar to piña weaving,
                  many of the needlework techniques have remained in use since
                  the nineteenth century.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-09lua-essay-fn15" id="page-09lua-essay-fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup>
                  During the nineteenth century, these historic embroidery
                  centers were located in various Manila neighborhoods, such as
                  Ermita, Malate, Santa Ana, Tondo, and Paco.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-09lua-essay-fn16" id="page-09lua-essay-fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup>
                  First, the bordadora would directly embroider on the cloth.
                  This technique allowed her to create the beautiful,
                  free-flowing designs typically seen on piña. The next step was
                  <em>bakbak</em>, or drawn threadwork, in which the bordadora
                  pulled threads from the woven cloth to open the plain weave
                  structure. The result is a gridlike fabric. Lastly, the
                  bordadora would embroider other designs in these open spaces
                  with a technique called <em>calado</em>, or open threadwork.
                  Here, the bordadora would be able to return to decorating with
                  organic lines and forms, and these designs are often in
                  repeating patterns as dictated by the grid drawn by the bakbak
                  of the previous step. Although Knapp’s cloth did not feature
                  any of these embroidered designs, piña fabrics operated within
                  an ecosystem of craft that connected weaving and needlework
                  across multiple islands.

                  After the cloth was embroidered—or if costumers wanted to keep
                  their fabric undecorated—consumers would have purchased the
                  original yardage and hired a costurera to make clothing.
                  During the nineteenth century, the sartorial culture of the
                  lowland Philippine region was such that the value of a garment
                  was attributed to the material of the clothing rather than the
                  silhouette. Due to the great labor involved in weaving piña,
                  very few could afford to buy the fabric, and piña garments
                  were usually reserved only for special occasions. As a result,
                  piña mostly clothed the elite men and women of Manila,
                  conveying a sense of <em>urbanidad</em>, or an attitude of
                  fashionable, urban refinement.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-09lua-essay-fn17" id="page-09lua-essay-fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  For women’s fashion, this economic hierarchy of material was
                  especially apparent as the outfits for women were the same
                  across every socioeconomic class. During the nineteenth
                  century, Filipino women wore the baro’t saya, which consisted
                  of a loose, cropped blouse, called the <em>baro</em>, and a
                  <em>saya</em>, or skirt. Sometimes, women could wear a
                  <em>pañuelo</em> (shawl) over their baro and a
                  <em>tapis</em> (overskirt) that would be wrapped around their
                  saya. The saya and tapis were usually made with thick, dark
                  material, but the baro could range in materials from abaca and
                  cotton to <em>jusi</em> and piña. Nevertheless, while the
                  outfits’ basic silhouettes were the same, the baro that was
                  woven with piña was more expensive, which made it more
                  luxurious than the baro woven with other materials. In the
                  watercolor <em>tipos del pais</em>, or “country types,”
                  paintings created by Damián Domingo (1796–1834), this shift is
                  evident in the blue, opaque fabric of the
                  <em>India Ollera de Pasig</em>’s baro versus the embroidered,
                  translucent baro, pañuelo, and head covering of the
                  <em>Mistisa de Manila</em> (figs. 11 and 12).

                  Men’s fashion featured a greater variety of silhouettes and
                  therefore depended less on this hierarchy of material to
                  signify the socioeconomic status of the wearer. Among these
                  outfits was the <em>barong mahaba</em>, a long, collared shirt
                  that men wore untucked (fig. 13). Most men on a day-to-day
                  basis, however, wore more simple silhouettes, such as the man
                  featured in Domingo’s <em>Indio de Yloco</em> (fig. 14). Set
                  against this Philippine cultural context, Knapp’s fragment
                  physically and figuratively represents only a piece of this
                  textile and fashion tradition, one whose cultural meaning
                  pulled from botanical history, craft knowledge, and sartorial
                  value.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-09lua-essay-fn18" id="page-09lua-essay-fnref18" class="footnote-ref-anchor">18</a></sup>

                  However, Knapp’s cloth did not make it into the barong mahaba
                  or baro’t saya of a Manila man or woman. Cut from its larger
                  fabric, Knapp’s cloth instead traveled from the Philippines to
                  Salem during a moment of economic transition. After the
                  British invaded Manila in the 1760s, Spanish economic control
                  over the Philippine colony weakened, resulting in the gradual
                  cessation of the Manila Galleon trade beginning in 1810 until
                  its last trip in 1815. Trade soon began to open to other
                  foreign merchants outside of Spain, like merchants from the
                  United States.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-09lua-essay-fn19" id="page-09lua-essay-fnref19" class="footnote-ref-anchor">19</a></sup>
                  Within the Philippines, beginning in 1778, General-Governor
                  José de Basco y Vargas looked to domestic agriculture to
                  supply cash crops for export as he foresaw the end to an
                  economy dependent on the Manila Galleon. This plan for
                  agricultural development coincided with an upsurge in local
                  textile production, which utilized the new crops resulting
                  from the general-governor’s program.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-09lua-essay-fn20" id="page-09lua-essay-fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup>
                  Knapp’s arrival to the Philippines and acquisition of piña was
                  a point of convergence in the archipelago’s history. The
                  captain had set foot in Manila not only as its ports opened to
                  merchants like him but also during a time when textiles like
                  his piña cloth were the country’s priority for economic
                  development.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As an item categorized under “articles of curiosity,” this
                  object’s classification is distinct from the return cargo that
                  East India Marine Society members brought back as import
                  goods. From the Philippines, Salem merchants brought back
                  indigo, which supplied the growing New England dyeing
                  industry, as well as sugar.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-09lua-essay-fn21" id="page-09lua-essay-fnref21" class="footnote-ref-anchor">21</a></sup>
                  Abaca, or what was known as Manila hemp, later entered the
                  market as a fiber popularly used for rope.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-09lua-essay-fn22" id="page-09lua-essay-fnref22" class="footnote-ref-anchor">22</a></sup>
                  In Salem, advertisements for Manila hemp cordage appear in the
                  <em>Salem Gazette</em> into the 1820s.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-09lua-essay-fn23" id="page-09lua-essay-fnref23" class="footnote-ref-anchor">23</a></sup>
                  Although Knapp’s piña cloth traveled on the same return trip
                  as these other products, the fabric, as an article of
                  curiosity, was separate from the items that traveled as import
                  goods.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Instead, Knapp’s piña cloth gives image to a different
                  material culture in the United States during the 1820s. With
                  the rise of early-nineteenth-century museums in New England
                  and the mid-Atlantic, objects of scientific inquiry were
                  collected from overseas trading ventures in addition to the
                  imported goods sold to the public. Born from
                  eighteenth-century European curiosity cabinets that housed
                  natural and ethnographic objects, institutions like the East
                  India Marine Society Museum fostered this spirit of discovery
                  through active collecting practices. In a similar expression
                  as the cabinet of curiosity, the pursuit for global objects
                  during the early nineteenth century was tied to larger
                  formulations of American national character, one that took
                  shape in relation to the young nation’s citizenship in the
                  world. As a port city with two active marine societies, Salem
                  was uniquely positioned to project this identity as American
                  traders went out and foreign goods entered, fortifying the
                  nation’s connection to the seas and lands beyond it.
                  Collecting articles of curiosity like Knapp’s piña thus served
                  a dual purpose of advancing scientific knowledge as an
                  implicit declaration of national standing.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-09lua-essay-fn24" id="page-09lua-essay-fnref24" class="footnote-ref-anchor">24</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  As a museum founded and maintained by its members, the East
                  India Marine Society charged both the mariners and its
                  institution with this mission for scientific advancement,
                  conflating both mariner and institutional knowledge of these
                  objects. The traders who had set out from Salem were the first
                  individuals through which knowledge of these items passed. Not
                  only was this expectation clearly stated in the Society’s
                  bylaws, but the journals that each ship was expected to keep
                  also gave detailed instructions regarding object collection.
                  At the tail end of several paragraphs that instruct the daily
                  recording of wind quality, latitude, longitude, and distance
                  traveled, the directions conclude with criteria for object
                  collection:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    There should be collected for the Museum, specimens of
                    various kinds of vegetable substances, earths, minerals,
                    ores, metals, volcanic substances, &amp;c. There should also
                    be preserved (according to the directions hereafter given)
                    such parts of birds, insects, fish, &amp;c. as serve most
                    easily to distinguish them. . . . Inquiry should be made for
                    any remarkable books in use among any of the eastern
                    nations, with their subjects, dates and titles. Articles of
                    the dress and ornaments of any nation, with the images and
                    objects of religious devotion, should be procured.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-09lua-essay-fn25" id="page-09lua-essay-fnref25" class="footnote-ref-anchor">25</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  For mariners like Captain J. J. Knapp, this commission
                  translated into an experiential knowledge of the objects. As
                  men who had set foot in these distant isles and countries,
                  even if for a moment compared to the months spent at sea, East
                  India Marine Society members collected these materials through
                  a direct experience that most did not have of the lands and
                  societies in which these objects originated. In other words,
                  unlike the many who mistook fabrics like cotton or silk as
                  piña, and vice versa, Knapp knew that his cloth was made from
                  pineapple leaf fibers because he had seen the fabric during
                  his time in Manila and was informed of its material.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, this experiential knowledge must be qualified, as it
                  was not the same as that possessed by those who made and wore
                  piña. For one, though Knapp had physically been in the
                  Philippines, his vocation was not one that allowed him to stay
                  in one place for too long. Unlike the expatriate who resided
                  in a given location for several years, captains and
                  supercargoes spent more time on the ocean than at their
                  destinations.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-09lua-essay-fn26" id="page-09lua-essay-fnref26" class="footnote-ref-anchor">26</a></sup>
                  As a result, his experiential knowledge was limited to what he
                  could learn about piña from local informants during his short
                  stay in one location. Furthermore, it is also possible that
                  Knapp might have learned more than what he shared with the
                  East India Marine Society. The brief record that made it onto
                  the cloth and into the East India Marine Society catalog might
                  be more reflective of cataloging convention rather than
                  Knapp’s complete understanding of the material. Nevertheless,
                  while Knapp might have learned that the fabric was indeed made
                  with pineapple leaf fibers, his knowledge did not extend
                  beyond what he saw and heard during his time in Manila. As a
                  mariner, Knapp received an incomplete knowledge of piña cloth,
                  returning to Salem unaware of where the cloth was woven and
                  the purposes for which it was used.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nevertheless, this partial understanding of piña fulfilled the
                  scientific inquiry requested by the East India Marine Society,
                  and it was this object knowledge that became institutional
                  through Knapp’s donation of the cloth to the museum. In the
                  1831 object catalog, the description written on Knapp’s piña
                  bore more empirical language. Rather than simply “Made of the
                  fibers of the Pine Apple,” as was written on the cloth,
                  Knapp’s piña became a “Specimen of Cloth manufactured from the
                  fibres of the Pine Apple, from Manilla.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-09lua-essay-fn27" id="page-09lua-essay-fnref27" class="footnote-ref-anchor">27</a></sup>
                  While the language of the description alone evokes the
                  scientific meaning that Knapp’s cloth had taken on, its
                  context within the rest of the museum’s collection of
                  Philippine objects emphasizes this transformation. Several
                  other objects from the Philippines were labeled as specimens,
                  such as a volcanic pitchstone and ammonite from Luzon, the
                  northern island region where Manila is located.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-09lua-essay-fn28" id="page-09lua-essay-fnref28" class="footnote-ref-anchor">28</a></sup>
                  Many items were not given the descriptor “specimen,” but they
                  did not deviate too far in nature from objects like the
                  pitchstone and ammonite. Examples include a Muraena fish, iron
                  ore, pearl nautilus cups, and a species of pigeon called
                  <em>Columba cruenta</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-09lua-essay-fn29" id="page-09lua-essay-fnref29" class="footnote-ref-anchor">29</a></sup>
                  There were a few objects that might have been classified as
                  more cultural than natural, such as a pair of women’s
                  slippers, swords, and cigars, so it is possible that Knapp’s
                  cloth may have been understood as examples of both Philippine
                  culture and natural history.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-09lua-essay-fn30" id="page-09lua-essay-fnref30" class="footnote-ref-anchor">30</a></sup>
                  Regardless, by the time of its acquisition, piña’s material
                  was stripped of its associations with early histories of craft
                  and cosmopolitan fashion in the Philippines. In the hands of
                  the institution, piña, in its partial understanding and
                  scientific use, along with the other Philippine objects in the
                  museum’s collection, became a material metonym for the
                  Philippines, filling the museum’s metaphorical display case of
                  global knowledge. Cut from the world, Knapp’s cloth remains an
                  archive of the world, weaving together multiple histories and
                  cultural meanings in its pineapple leaf materiality.

                        While trade between the Philippines and Salem was

                        1991), 26–27. Montinola’s volume continues to be the
                        authority for most scholarship on the pineapple’s
                        history in the Philippines. Here, she writes of
                        different pathways that the pineapple could have taken
                        in the hands of fifteenth-century Portuguese and Spanish
                        explorers. Elena Phipps cites other sources in her essay
                        on the international trade of silk, cotton, banana
                        fiber, and piña textiles, but these sources also look
                        primarily to Montinola’s volume for the history of the
                        pineapple in the Philippines. With the exception of
                        Antonio Pigafetta’s text from 1521, Montinola’s evidence
                        draws mostly from twentieth-century US sources. A deeper
                        study of the pinapple’s botanical history would enrich
                        future scholarship on piña cloth. Elena Phipps, “Silk,

                        Translucence.” Montinola, for instance, documents the
                        contemporary techniques of weaving piña in her
                        monograph, explaining the endurance of these processes
                        into the twentieth century. In 2022, I was also able to
                        visit these piña weaving communities to learn about the
                        material and their craft. In particular, I thank the
                        weavers of Dela Cruz House of Piña, Raquel’s Piña Cloth
                        Products, and La Herminia for their generosity in time
                        and expertise. I also thank Anna India Dela Cruz
                        Legaspi. I draw from this fieldwork for my discussion of
                        Knapp’s cloth.

                        A note on the technological continuity of piña
                        production is important here. Before my fieldwork, I was
                        suspicious of many publications’ assumption that the
                        tools and processes of making piña remained unchanged.
                        However, as I met with artisans and observed their
                        craft, the nuances between change and continuity became
                        more evident. While there are certainly a few processes
                        that are now mechanized for greater efficiency, the
                        delicate nature of piña fiber has mostly resisted the
                        use of other tools that might damage the material. See
                        Lua, “Interrogating Translucence,” 25–26.

                        In addition to a plain-weave structure, weavers also

                  Acapulco is a famous vacation destination today, especially
                  for people from Mexico City. Its appeal began in the 1950s,
                  when Hollywood actors and the international jet set flocked to
                  its sunny shores. However, relatively few people outside
                  academic circles know about the Acapulco–Manila Galleon trade
                  route and the renowned Acapulco Fair, where silver from the
                  Americas traded for a wide range of luxurious and exotic goods
                  from across the ocean. Although Acapulco was a small port
                  until the second half of the twentieth century, it was a nodal
                  point in sixteenth- to early nineteenth-century global
                  commerce. First, it was the designated American port for the
                  Acapulco–Manila route (the name depending on whether the ship
                  was sailing to or from Manila or Acapulco), bridging both
                  sides of the Pacific. Second, it was also connected to the
                  ports of Panama and Callao, Peru, with merchants arriving with
                  South American silver. Mexico City was a short way from
                  Acapulco, connecting to Puebla, Veracruz, and then on to the
                  Atlantic and Caribbean.

                  Much archaeological research has been undertaken in the last
                  decade, feeding into what can be called an “archaeology of the
                  Manila Galleon.” The most significant body of work
                  aoncentrates on ceramics, including style, provenance,
                  distribution, and consumption studies. For many years,
                  archaeological evidence from different shipwrecks and
                  excavations has contributed to our understanding of
                  transpacific trade. Archaeological work has revealed
                  production centers and even specific kiln sites, as well as
                  studies of porcelain commercialization, use, and influence in
                  Mexico and Manila, among others.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-03junco-essay-fn1" id="page-03junco-essay-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                  Since 2015, archaeological excavations at Acapulco have
                  yielded an interesting collection of porcelain. This brings to
                  light new evidence about the port’s commercial activity and a
                  better understanding of the types of pieces available for
                  commercialization in New Spain and beyond. Some of the sherds
                  tell individual stories and contribute to our understanding of
                  the early modern world and the Manila Galleon.

                <p><strong>Acapulco</strong></p>
                <p>
                  Designated in 1573 as the official terminus of the
                  Acapulco–Manila Galleon route, Acapulco’s well-protected
                  harbor became the entry and exit point for galleons traveling
                  along this crucial commercial route for over 250 years. In
                  1565, the first galleon, the <em>San Pedro</em>, under the
                  direction of fray Andrés de Urdaneta, discovered the
                  <em>tornaviaje</em>, or return route, from the Philippines,
                  following the northern Pacific currents to the American
                  continent and then sailing south to reach Acapulco. This
                  development made it possible to establish a continuous
                  connection between Acapulco and Manila. Manila itself was part
                  of a preexisting network of Asian commercial routes. The
                  Spanish Crown protected this trade route from competing
                  interests, such as the merchants from Seville or Lima. Under
                  the direction of the Casa de la Contratación, the merchants of
                  Mexico controlled the trade, fighting with the irregular
                  Peruvian ships and merchants that made the voyage yearly for
                  the best products and prices. Taxation on imported products
                  helped finance the administration of the Philippines and
                  supported the Church in the islands. Historical accounts
                  mention the luxurious items that passed through Acapulco,
                  including silks, cotton, and other textiles from India, China,
                  and the Philippines; spices and precious woods from Southeast
                  Asia; lacquerware and screens from Japan; and ceramics from
                  China.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Several historical figures testify that Acapulco was an ideal
                  port, as William Lytle Schurz pointed out in his famous 1939
                  book on the Manila Galleon:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    Domingo Fernández de Navarrete, a much-traveled friar,
                    called it “the best and safest harbor in the world, as was
                    duly asserted by those who have seen many others.” Of the
                    size of the harbor Dampier remarks: “The Port of Acapulco is
                    very commodious for the reception of Ships, and so large,
                    that some hundreds may safely Ride there without damnifying
                    each other.” Lord Anson considered it “the securest and
                    finest in all the northern parts of the Pacific Ocean.”
                    Malaspina, one of the most skilled of Spanish navigators of
                    the later eighteenth century, a scientific seaman of the
                    type of Cook and Bougainville, favored the further
                    development of Acapulco as a Spanish naval base for the
                    northern Pacific and a great commercial port. He thought it
                    much superior to San Blas. “No one can deny,” he said, “that
                    Acapulco has great advantages which are found together in
                    very few ports of the globe.” Humboldt, who saw the place in
                    1803, thus describes the harbor, which he called “the finest
                    of all those on the coast of the great ocean,” and again
                    “one of the finest ports in the known world:” “The port of
                    Acapulco forms an immense basin cut in granite rocks.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-03junco-essay-fn2" id="page-03junco-essay-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>

                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Despite the galleons, the annual fair, and the arrival of
                  Peruvian ships and merchants from the interior, Acapulco
                  remained modest throughout its historical period (fig. 1). Its
                  most prominent structure was the Fort of San Diego. Other
                  notable buildings included the cathedral church, a Franciscan
                  convent, the San Juan de Dios Hospital, and the Royal
                  Contaduría. None of them were significant or strongly built.
                  In 1598, some 250 tiny houses existed, made of wood, adobe,
                  and palm. The hot climate, the mosquitos and animals, and the
                  lack of food, among other reasons, made it hellish for a
                  population to develop. Many accounts from travelers and
                  administrators attest to this.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-03junco-essay-fn3" id="page-03junco-essay-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>

                  In 1578, fear spread through New Spain as it became known that
                  Francis Drake passed northward through the viceroyalty,
                  attacking the town of Huatulco. The same happened when Thomas
                  Cavendish, in 1587, captured the galleon <em>Santa Ana</em> at
                  the tip of Baja California. However, it was the Dutch attack
                  on Acapulco in 1615 by Joris van Spilbergen that prompted the
                  viceroy, Diego Fernández de Córdoba, 1st Marquess of
                  Guadalcázar, to commission the construction of a new redoubt
                  from the engineer Adrian Boot, who oversaw the drainage works
                  in Mexico City. However, the viceroy rejected the initial
                  proposal because it was small and insufficient. Boot then sent
                  a fortification project consisting of five towers joined
                  together with projections to give a pentagonal shape, which
                  was approved. Work started in 1616, on top of a promontory
                  dominating the bay to prevent attacks by pirates and enemies
                  of the Crown who entered the bay. It was completed by February
                  1617. The fortress remained impregnable throughout the
                  colonial period, except for a brief attack by Dutch pirates in
                  1624. However, a severe earthquake on April 2, 1776, caused
                  substantial damage, leading to reconstruction efforts that
                  commenced in 1778 and concluded in 1783. The rebuilt fortress,
                  made of stone and surrounded by a moat, could accommodate up
                  to two thousand people with ample provisions for a year.
                  Initiated in 1810, the independence movement in Mexico became
                  interested in capturing Acapulco. General José María Morelos
                  sieged the Fort of San Diego for two years. The War of
                  Independence ended the route; the last ship sailed off into
                  the Pacific in 1815, ending a long, prosperous line. Acapulco
                  remained sleepy until new opportunities came in the form of
                  tourism and it regained its celebrated name.

                <p><strong>Manila Galleon Archaeology</strong></p>
                <p>
                  The archaeological interest in the colonial period of Acapulco
                  arose from broader interest in the archaeology of the Manila
                  Galleon, a theme and an approach that explores all aspects of
                  the galleons, such as infrastructure, maritime and nautical
                  aspects, trade, cultural influences, distribution, etc. and
                  which has been developing through several papers and
                  archaeological interventions over time.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-03junco-essay-fn4" id="page-03junco-essay-fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                  As José Luis Gasch-Tomás has noted: “Unfortunately, the
                  archaeological studies of the Manila galleons have not
                  developed as much as their histories. Apart from a few
                  excavated underwater sites and several studies of the material
                  culture transported in the galleons, especially Chinese
                  porcelain and to a lesser extent Chinese silk and Japanese
                  furniture, experts have undertaken few archaeological
                  researches of the Manila galleons.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-03junco-essay-fn5" id="page-03junco-essay-fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>
                  Among the few projects focused on shipwrecks recently
                  conducted are the search for the galleon
                  <em>San Francisco</em> in Japan by archaeologist Jun Kimura
                  and several in the Philippines by Bobby Orillaneda and his
                  team.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-03junco-essay-fn6" id="page-03junco-essay-fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 2000, the Underwater Archaeology Office (SAS) of the
                  National Institute of Anthropology and History of Mexico
                  (INAH) began researching the remains of a sixteenth-century
                  Manila galleon, wrecked on the journey from the Philippines to
                  New Spain, on the coast of Baja California at the 38th
                  parallel. This desolate, desert-like region by the ocean holds
                  remains of the ship’s cargo scattered along eleven kilometers
                  of the shoreline. A reference to the shipwreck site appeared
                  in George Kuwayama’s
                  <em>Chinese Ceramics in Colonial Mexico</em> (1997).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-03junco-essay-fn7" id="page-03junco-essay-fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>
                  His book presented images of Chinese porcelain sherds from an
                  “unpublished site off the Baja California coast.” This
                  citation aroused the interest of maritime historian Edward Von
                  der Porten, who contacted him for more information. Kuwayama
                  revealed that beachcombers had collected porcelain sherds from
                  the site. In 1999, with this knowledge and under the
                  supervision of INAH, Von der Porten, along with archaeologists
                  Jack Hunter and Edward Ritter, organized the first expedition
                  to the site thanks to the beachcombers’ information (fig. 2).
                  SAS-INAH subsequently established the archaeological project
                  “Manila Galleon, Baja California,” providing financial support
                  for ongoing excavations, conservation, and research until Von
                  der Porten’s passing in 2019. To date, 3,787 artifacts have
                  been documented at the site, with extensive finds from the
                  Chinese Wanli period (1573–1620), totaling 1,923 pieces. The
                  collection primarily includes underglaze blue-and-white
                  plates, bowls, cups, bottles, and boxes, alongside polychrome
                  pieces studied by Von der Porten. The porcelain was
                  manufactured in Jingdezhen (Jiangxi province) and Zhangzhou
                  (Fujian province), and it significantly resembles the pieces
                  from the sunken Chinese vessel <em>Nan’ao 1</em>, thought to
                  have been en route to Manila in the early stages of the trade
                  route.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-03junco-essay-fn8" id="page-03junco-essay-fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>
                  Additionally, at least five different types of stoneware
                  sherds and complete pieces from southern China and Southeast
                  Asia (possibly northern Vietnam) have been identified and were
                  likely used as containers during the voyage. Other significant
                  finds include fragments of Spanish olive jars, cloisonné
                  plates, Mexican silver coins, a Chinese coin, small lead
                  objects, pieces of beeswax, lead shot, metal fittings, a
                  bronze incense burner cover shaped like a Fu dog, and compass
                  gimbals.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-03junco-essay-fn9" id="page-03junco-essay-fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>
                  These artifacts provide crucial insights into the cargo
                  carried aboard the galleons and the ship construction
                  technology of that era.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-03junco-essay-fn10" id="page-03junco-essay-fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup>

                  In 2006, an archaeological survey along the north coast of the
                  state of Guerrero indicated possible smuggling activities
                  related to the Manila Galleon route. Ming dynasty (1368–1644)
                  porcelain sherds and a type of maiolica known as Romita
                  Sgraffito were recorded. Around the same time, neutron
                  activation analysis revealed this type of slipware was made in
                  the region of the lakes of Michoacán. Therefore, the
                  hypothesis is that some smuggled porcelain was destined for
                  this region as part of an exchange route not documented in the
                  historical record, revealing that not all Asian merchandise
                  arrived in Acapulco before traveling to Mexico City as was the
                  norm. Alternative, lesser-known routes were utilized for
                  trade. The coastal area of Petatlán, to the north, was ideal
                  for ships to anchor and load water, facilitating the unloading
                  of select cargo items.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-03junco-essay-fn11" id="page-03junco-essay-fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup>

                <p>
                  In 2016 and 2017, SAS-INAH conducted an archaeological
                  inspection of the Port of San Blas on the Pacific coast of
                  Mexico, which yielded a collection of Chinese porcelain sherds
                  linked to the transpacific trade (fig. 3). Although officially
                  active only for a few decades in the eighteenth century, this
                  port served as a stop along the Manila Galleon route. The
                  predominant type of porcelain in the collection is landscape
                  designs produced in Jingdezhen, which later developed into the
                  “willow pattern.” The second most common type is
                  blue-and-white Jingdezhen porcelain, followed by red overglaze
                  bowls known as Guanzai, dated from the mid-seventeenth to
                  nineteenth centuries, indicating a continued movement of Asian
                  goods even prior to San Blas’s establishment as a maritime
                  department. As Gasch-Tomás mentions, “Remains of shipwrecks
                  and Chinese porcelain are becoming as important as archival
                  documents to write the history of the Manila galleons.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-03junco-essay-fn12" id="page-03junco-essay-fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup>
                  Indeed, porcelain has been archaeologically reported in the
                  past in Mexico as elsewhere by authors like Goggin, Lister and
                  Lister, López Cervantes, Pierson, and Fournier, among
                  others.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-03junco-essay-fn13" id="page-03junco-essay-fnref13" class="footnote-ref-anchor">13</a></sup>
                  A distribution map showing archaeological finds of these
                  ceramics was published in 2019 by Fournier and Junco.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-03junco-essay-fn14" id="page-03junco-essay-fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup>
                  Many noteworthy archaeological works have been published
                  since, some about specific sites like the kilns in China, new
                  wrecks found in the Philippines, and ports and cities along
                  the route. It would be another type of undertaking to be able
                  to cite them all, but allow me to highlight some notable
                  contributions, such as the work of Guanyu Wang, who
                  characterized the porcelain traded by the Manila Galleon in
                  the early part of the trade, during the Ming dynasty,
                  describing three key moments.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-03junco-essay-fn15" id="page-03junco-essay-fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup>
                  In the same book, Nida Cuevas writes about Fujian and Hizen
                  wares found in the Philippines, Tai-Kang Lu addresses Kraak
                  pieces from Macau and Taiwan linked to the Manila Galleon, and
                  Etsuko Miyata describes the ceramics at Nagasaki and their
                  relation to the Galleon.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-03junco-essay-fn16" id="page-03junco-essay-fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup>
                  Archaeology is in an interesting position from which to study
                  not simply the design, distribution, and evolution of
                  porcelain but also the preferences of consumers. Furthermore,
                  symbolic aspects (as mentioned in the work of Skowronek) and
                  stylistic influences on Mexican ceramics from the imported
                  Chinese porcelain appear in shape, color, and style (as in the
                  work of Castillo and Fournier).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-03junco-essay-fn17" id="page-03junco-essay-fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup>
                  It also allows us to reconstruct aspects of the past, such as
                  in San Blas, where porcelain allows us to understand the
                  temporality of the site beyond historical references,
                  including smuggling routes which by nature are little
                  documented, or as in Acapulco, where the distribution of
                  porcelain permits us to make inferences on the location of the
                  fair and where the galleon was unloaded. In recent years, a
                  vibrant study of these topics has emerged and will contribute
                  significantly to understanding the Manila Galleon from a
                  material perspective.

                  Historically, archaeological research in Acapulco has
                  primarily focused on prehispanic remains around the bay. The
                  area is home to various recorded archaeological sites,
                  petroglyphs, and ceramic artifacts, some of which are among
                  the oldest ceramics in Mesoamerica.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-03junco-essay-fn18" id="page-03junco-essay-fnref18" class="footnote-ref-anchor">18</a></sup>
                  However, little attention had been given to the colonial
                  period, and no materials were reported until 2015. That year,
                  excavations at the Fort of San Diego uncovered enough evidence
                  to initiate a long-overdue project focused on the colonial
                  period (fig. 4). In 2015, the SAS-INAH responded to a report
                  in Acapulco Bay and documented some historical objects that
                  divers retrieved from the water. Also, excavations in Acapulco
                  commenced as a rescue effort linked to maintenance work on the
                  outer wall of the San Diego fortress, which is now the History
                  Museum of Acapulco, recovering archaeological materials from
                  the prehispanic, early contact, colonial, and republican
                  periods. This excavation found various materials such as
                  ceramics, metal, glass, stone, and bone. Among the ceramics
                  are sherds of prehispanic and local wares, Spanish olive jars,
                  Chinese porcelain, English transfer-printed pottery, and Asian
                  stoneware. Archaeological research focusing on the colonial
                  period in Acapulco has led to the developmente of a
                  comprehensive project that includes underwater and land
                  investigations at the port, the “Proyecto de Arqueología
                  Marítima del Puerto de Acapulco” (PAMPA, or Maritime
                  Archaeology Project at the Port of Acapulco), which aims to
                  reconstruct historic Acapulco’s maritime activity. One of the
                  main goals of PAMPA is to understand the relationship between
                  archaeological materials and trade dynamics over time,
                  examining how these evolved and changed. Since Acapulco was
                  the gateway between New Spain and the Pacific Ocean,
                  investigating the archaeological remains at the port is key to
                  understanding commercial dynamics of the colonial period. The
                  project also involves documenting shipwrecks and the remains
                  of vessels to catalog all historical elements found within the
                  bay. The project employs a variety of theoretical approaches,
                  including historical archaeology and maritime archaeology, to
                  interpret these findings.

                  A second archaeological excavation took place in downtown
                  Acapulco in 2016, where the local government initiated a
                  thirty-meter ditch for a water system replacement adjacent to
                  the Cathedral on Francisco I. Madero, La Paz, and José María
                  Iglesias streets. This two-meter-deep ditch unveiled thousands
                  of blue-and-white porcelain fragments, primarily of the Kraak
                  porcelain style produced in various private kilns in
                  Jingdezhen. Given the site’s central location, it is
                  hypothesized that it may have been where the traditional
                  Acapulco Fair was hosted annually just after the arrival of
                  the Manila Galleon every December or January. The similarities
                  in motifs on the porcelain sherds and their size suggest that
                  many pieces sustained damage during the long five- to
                  six-month voyage from Asia to Acapulco, with some items likely
                  breaking en route and being discarded upon arrival.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-03junco-essay-fn19" id="page-03junco-essay-fnref19" class="footnote-ref-anchor">19</a></sup>
                  Three test pits on the slopes of Fort San Diego were
                  excavated. Many materials were recovered during this season,
                  including over five thousand pieces of Chinese porcelain,
                  mainly from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.

                  In 2017, further archaeological rescue was conducted in the
                  town center, focusing on several streets, especially parts of
                  La Quebrada street. In 2018, excavations were carried out at
                  Fort San Diego, with four excavation units recovering material
                  and documenting an architectural element before a section of
                  the fort wall. In 2019, restoration work was performed on the
                  mentioned part of the old fort, and it was reburied. This
                  project has recovered over ten thousand colonial-period
                  artifacts, including Chinese porcelains, maiolica and colonial
                  ceramics, English earthenware, metal artifacts, and glass.

                  In the 2020 season, activities were proposed related to the
                  organization of the information generated, as well as
                  documentary research efforts, highlighting access to digital
                  collections for the creation of a digital and physical library
                  of maps and plans of the port of Acapulco and Fort San Diego
                  from the colonial era. Additionally, dissemination talks were
                  planned for primary schools and carried out remotely. Once
                  normal post-pandemic activities resumed in 2023, office work
                  focused on analysis of the recovered porcelain collection and
                  creating a database for information and consultation. Finally,
                  in 2024, along with Dr. Ivan Valdéz of UNAM, we curated the
                  restructuring of the museography content at Fort San Diego,
                  displaying some of the pieces recovered from the excavations
                  conducted there (fig. 5).

                  While Chinese porcelain had not been previously documented
                  archaeologically in Acapulco, the more than 6,500 fragments
                  identified to date are noteworthy. Preliminary analysis
                  indicates that, within the fortress, most of the porcelain
                  dates to the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, whereas the
                  porcelain found in downtown Acapulco belongs to the sixteenth
                  and early seventeenth centuries; some of the sherds appear to
                  be from very early in the route, the 1560s and 1570s. This
                  discrepancy can be attributed to the fortress’s destruction
                  during an earthquake in 1766, followed by its reconstruction.
                  In contrast, the downtown area, where more than 90 percent of
                  all porcelain was recovered, mainly from the Wanli period
                  (1573–1620) of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), may well be the
                  site of the cargo offloading, the area for opening containers,
                  and where the Acapulco Fair was held annually. Some of the
                  pieces in the collection point to this fact. For example, over
                  a dozen fragments of a delicate plate representing deer in the
                  park from the Ming dynasty can be said to have come from the
                  same hand (fig. 6). When we overlap the fragments, we see they
                  are almost identical in the paintwork. As with a puzzle, the
                  fragments that could not be joined belong to at least four
                  plates, maybe six or more. Having been made and packed in
                  Jingdezhen, they traveled to the coast, sailed to Manila, then
                  sailed to Mexico, and arrived partially broken in Acapulco
                  (fig. 7). They were likely discarded in the same place where
                  the unpacking was done during the Acapulco Fair. A dozen
                  plates were bundled together, and a few cracked. Whatever the
                  fact, they are also important as they are the finest example
                  of a considerable number of plates with a deer-in-the-park
                  design. There is also a plate from around the same period from
                  Zhangzhou, somewhat reconstructed, and it has a lower-quality
                  design of a deer in the park in the collection (fig. 8).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-03junco-essay-fn20" id="page-03junco-essay-fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup>
                  This comparison gives us a range of what the consumers in New
                  Spain acquired.

                  As with the plates mentioned earlier, around two dozen
                  fragments of large bowls with deer (ca. 1580–95) suggest items
                  discarded when unpacked (fig. 9). Although the deer are not
                  identical in all (some are), they are the same shape and
                  design with slight variations; for instance, the dotting in
                  the deer is sometimes in clusters of four and in other
                  instances is in lines. The interior base presents, in all but
                  one, a rabbit. A few small bowls also repeat the deer motif in
                  a smaller version. The same thing occurs with the typical cups
                  decorated with a crow motif (ca. 1590–1600). There are a dozen
                  bases with this motif, with slight variations of the bird in
                  the interior bottom of the cup and the exterior decoration.

                  A fascinating example of the porcelain that arrived in Mexico
                  is a sherd identified by Etsuko Miyata as the well-known scene
                  of the poem “Lanting Xu.” The famous Chinese poem narrates an
                  event that took place in 353 CE during the Jin dynasty
                  (265–420) when the poet and calligrapher Wang Xizhi (303–361)
                  gathered with fellow literati at the Orchid Pavilion to
                  celebrate the Spring Purification ritual. They collectively
                  composed thirty-seven poems, among which Wang wrote the
                  “Lanting Xu,” serving as a preface to their work.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-03junco-essay-fn22" id="page-03junco-essay-fnref22" class="footnote-ref-anchor">22</a></sup>
                  The poem has become one of China’s masterpieces of
                  calligraphy. Over a millennium later, this story was depicted
                  on a blue-and-white porcelain bowl produced in Jingdezhen at
                  the end of the Ming dynasty (fig. 10). Like many other goods,
                  the understandings of these objects varied among the
                  individuals who crafted them in China, those who traded them
                  in the Philippines, and those who bought them in New Spain and
                  beyond. Exploring these perspectives can provide a more
                  comprehensive understanding of the interconnected societies
                  involved.

                  Overall, the downtown segment of the collection contains early
                  blue-and-white Zhangzhou pieces, fine early Wanli, typical
                  export wares (such as the phoenix plates), and some
                  polychromed plates and bowls, which are very similar to the
                  ones found in Baja California and the <em>Nan’ao 1</em> wreck
                  (fig. 11). Fragments of Kraak saucer dishes, plates, small
                  plates, bowls, bottles, dishes, ewers, <em>klapmuts</em>,
                  cups, boxes, and jars are present.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-03junco-essay-fn23" id="page-03junco-essay-fnref23" class="footnote-ref-anchor">23</a></sup>
                  One sherd was identified as having been reused as a tool for
                  cutting. On the bottom of a phoenix plate, the foot and base
                  were flaked on both sides to make a cutting implement. Few
                  chocolate cups appear, a design that would become very common.
                  Few Qing dynasty (1644–1911) pieces were recovered. No
                  <em>Imari</em> or enameled pieces are present as are in Mexico
                  City, for example. The end of the Ming dynasty in the
                  seventeenth century interrupted porcelain production and flow
                  to New Spain, with the Galleon bringing fewer porcelains
                  compared to textiles, though perhaps fewer objects have been
                  found due to porcelains in different packing, unloading cargo
                  into other spaces in the port, or having larger, more stable
                  ships. These thoughts are inquiries to make sense of the
                  pattern.

                  The sherds from the fort are very different. European
                  decorations are abundant, as are some blue-and-white Canton
                  wares. A few white “Dehua” pieces, such as cups, boxes, and
                  the foot of a lion, are present. Armorial designs are but two
                  so far: One is a small fragment, likely from a plate with a
                  heraldic composition of a lion behind a red and gold flag;
                  another is the body of a chocolate cup with what appears to be
                  Ferdinand VII’s monogram (fig. 12). The design is in oxide red
                  and gold, clearly depicting the Roman numeral VII above the
                  letter F. A similar monogram appears in the commemorative coin
                  of his coronation. The extraordinary thing is that Ferdinand
                  VII became king in 1808 and had to abdicate to Napoleon’s
                  pressure shortly thereafter. After commissioning a porcelain
                  set in his honor, the chocolate cup would have arrived two or
                  three years later. He became king again in late 1813, only two
                  years before the last galleon departed Acapulco in 1815. It is
                  almost certain that these commemorative works would have
                  arrived in New Spain after Ferdinand’s abdication and would
                  have thus been discarded.

                <p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>
                <p>
                  The port of Acapulco, the origin and terminus of the
                  Acapulco–Manila Galleon route, has been the focus of extensive
                  archaeological work since 2015. Inspired by Manila Galleon
                  studies, this maritime archaeology project seeks to explore
                  the material aspects of this trade route. The project,
                  conducted by the Underwater Archaeology Office (SAS) of INAH,
                  has completed several field seasons and recovered a
                  significant collection of objects. In the first five field
                  seasons (2015–19), it recorded more than 6,500 sherds of
                  Chinese porcelain, Asian stoneware, olive jars, Mexican
                  majolica, and local wares, illustrating Acapulco’s trading
                  significance and daily life through ceramics. Excavations at
                  the fort have incorporated test pits and geophysical
                  explorations to locate the original fort structure that
                  collapsed in 1766 due to an earthquake. Analysis of
                  archaeological materials has provided insights into their
                  provenance and exchanges during this period. Preliminary
                  analysis of the porcelain suggests that while most of it
                  belongs to the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in the Fort
                  of San Diego, in downtown Acapulco it belongs to the sixteenth
                  and first half of the seventeenth centuries. In the case of
                  downtown, it could be the area of the cargo offloading, the
                  opening of containers, and where the Acapulco Fair took place.
                  Most of these sherds were likely pieces that arrived broken
                  from the long journey and discarded in situ. The collection of
                  Chinese porcelain excavated by PAMPA in Acapulco features a
                  variety of types imported to New Spain that makes it a unique
                  catalog of the different shapes and designs that traversed the
                  Pacific Ocean. A detailed catalog of the collection is
                  forthcoming.

                  It is impossible to walk through the historic center of the
                  city of Puebla de los Ángeles (known as Puebla) without
                  encountering the myriad shops lined with colorful glazed
                  pottery, popularly known as <em>talavera poblana</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-04mcquade-essay-fn1" id="page-04mcquade-essay-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                  In addition to vibrant tableware, ceramic tiles adorn the
                  walls and floors of religious and civic buildings including
                  the endless church domes that define the city’s skyline. These
                  colorful remnants speak to the long tradition that began
                  nearly five hundred years ago with the founding of the city.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During the viceregal period of New Spain (1519–1821)—as Mexico
                  was known—Puebla pottery gained widespread popularity across
                  the Americas, reaching regions throughout Central and South
                  America, the Caribbean, and present-day southeastern and
                  southwestern United States. Despite fluctuations in production
                  over the centuries, the tradition has persisted without
                  interruption. Today, Puebla’s ceramic tradition is celebrated
                  internationally; however, little attention is given to the
                  individuals who created these renowned wares. This essay aims
                  to shed light on the artisans behind Puebla’s famed ceramics
                  and to associate specific pieces with the potters and their
                  workshops.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The tools and techniques for producing tin-glazed earthenware
                  were introduced to New Spain by Spanish potters, building upon
                  the rich legacy of ceramic production that had flourished in
                  Mesoamerica for thousands of years. Pottery in Mesoamerica was
                  hand-built or mold-made, often adorned with colored slip and
                  stamped designs, burnished for a smooth finish, and fired in
                  pit kilns. The pottery of Cholula—located close to the city of
                  Puebla—was particularly well developed by the time of the
                  arrival of the Spanish and had enjoyed widespread circulation
                  throughout Mesoamerica.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-04mcquade-essay-fn2" id="page-04mcquade-essay-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Despite the appeal of Indigenous pottery, Spanish settlers
                  sought the wheel-thrown, tin- and lead-glazed earthenware
                  (also known as <em>maiolica</em>) they were accustomed to
                  using in Spain. Initially, Spanish glazed ceramic ware was
                  imported to the Americas from Spain; it met the demand of
                  recent settlers and served as excellent ballast for
                  transatlantic galleons. However, as the settler population
                  grew, Spanish workshops could no longer supply sufficient
                  wares. By the mid-sixteenth century, Spanish potters began to
                  migrate to New Spain, bringing essential tools—such as the
                  potter’s wheel, tin- and lead-based glazes, and updraft
                  kilns—necessary for achieving a vitreous glazed ceramic ware.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The first known workshops of glazed ware in the Americas were
                  established in Mexico City before 1537 by Spanish potters
                  Francisco de la Reyna and Francisco Morales.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-04mcquade-essay-fn3" id="page-04mcquade-essay-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                  While production continued in Mexico City, Puebla quickly
                  emerged as the dominant center of ceramic manufacture by the
                  end of the sixteenth century. Founded in 1531 as the second
                  city of New Spain, Puebla was designed as an urban model for
                  Spanish settlement and an industrial center for the
                  manufacture of European-style goods. In addition to tin-glazed
                  ceramics, the city produced soap, glass, and textiles.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If the location of Puebla was influenced by potters, they
                  chose wisely. The climate was mild, the soil was rich, and
                  there were extensive clay beds and raw sodium essential for
                  glaze preparation. Ceramic workshops clustered in the center
                  of the city, within blocks of the cathedral and central
                  square. By 1653, when the potters’ guild was officially
                  established, the church of San Marcos had become the seat for
                  the trade. The town council (<em>ayuntamiento</em>) first
                  designated the site as the parish church San Antonio Abad in
                  1538, long before the present facade of the church of San
                  Marcos was completed in 1797 (fig. 1).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-04mcquade-essay-fn4" id="page-04mcquade-essay-fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                  While the name of the church changed a couple times before it
                  was dedicated to San Marcos in the seventeenth century, it is
                  believed to have always been the location where the potters’
                  confraternity and guild held meetings and celebrated
                  festivities.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-04mcquade-essay-fn5" id="page-04mcquade-essay-fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>
                  The church of San Marcos is also named as a reference point
                  for the location of workshops, underscoring the importance of
                  the site as central area for Puebla potters. For example, in
                  1647 and 1660, the workshop locations of master potters
                  Alfonso Sevillano and Nicólas de la Cueva were listed in
                  operation “on the street of Plaza Publica, at the church of

                  The first workshops in Puebla were situated on Calle los
                  Herreros (“street of the blacksmiths”), indicating the
                  proximity to other essential trades. As the industry expanded
                  in the seventeenth century, workshops congregated along
                  Poniente 700, including the workshops (<em>Lozerías</em>) of
                  Cabezas, Zayas, and Alfaro, which continued to operate for
                  over two hundred years.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-04mcquade-essay-fn7" id="page-04mcquade-essay-fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>
                  The workshop of Cabezas, one of the largest workshops in the
                  eighteenth century, was likely abandoned after a fire in the
                  early twentieth century. Its two-story structure, adorned with
                  brickwork, tiles, and cherubic figures, suggests its
                  prominence. Nearby, the more modest Zayas workshop housed
                  generations of potters dating back to 1674. Matrimonial
                  records identify Nicolás de Zayas as a mestizo (a person of
                  Spanish and Indigenous descent) and an “official potter of
                  white ware” (<em>oficial locero de lo blanco</em>), with
                  subsequent generations continuing the craft.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-04mcquade-essay-fn8" id="page-04mcquade-essay-fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>
                  Other known members of the Zayas family who became master
                  potters include José de Zayas (active ca. 1714–30), Nicolás de
                  Zayas (active ca. 1734), Sebastián de Zayas, the elder (<em>el viejo</em>) (died 1746), Sebastián de Zayas, the younger (<em>el mozo</em>) (born 1715, active ca. 1750), and Antonio de Zayas (active
                  ca. 1772).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-04mcquade-essay-fn9" id="page-04mcquade-essay-fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>

                  Puebla potters were sufficiently organized by the last quarter
                  of the sixteenth century, with their appointment of aldermen
                  and inspectors. In 1573, Juan Vázquez served as alderman
                  (<em>alcalde</em>) and Francisco Trujillo served as inspector
                  (<em>veedor</em>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-04mcquade-essay-fn10" id="page-04mcquade-essay-fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup>
                  The alderman was the administrator and a link to city
                  authorities, and the inspector was responsible for making
                  periodic inspections of workshops to ensure the observance of
                  required rules and regulations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Production in Puebla became substantial enough by the
                  mid-seventeenth century for the potters to formalize a guild
                  in 1653. Together, they petitioned the viceroy to use the
                  municipal ordinances to establish standards of production and
                  distribution that would serve to control the trade. The
                  ordinances outlined ten articles specifying requirements for
                  guild membership, prerequisites for master potters, steps for
                  processing clay and glaze mixtures, and the manner in which
                  pieces were to be decorated. The three potters designated to
                  lead the guild in 1653 were Diego Salvador Carreto, Damián
                  Hernández, and Andrés de Haro. Carreto was appointed
                  inspector, Hernández for white ware (<em>diputado para lo blanco</em>), and Haro for common or yellow ware (<em>diputado por lo amarillo</em>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-04mcquade-essay-fn11" id="page-04mcquade-essay-fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  To regulate production, the ordinances specified three types
                  of pottery: cooking ware, common ware, and fine ware (<em>loza amarilla</em>, <em>loza común</em>, and <em>loza fina</em>). Later a
                  refine ware (<em>loza refina</em>) was added, stipulating that
                  it was reserved for blue-and-white Chinese-style decoration.
                  Those who produced common ware could not produce fine ware
                  unless they had passed an exam and were confirmed by the guild
                  as a master potter.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The city was dominated by Spaniards, and thus, the ordinances
                  decreed only men of pure Spanish parentage could be considered
                  for the master potter examination. However, while the guild
                  was largely controlled by Spaniards, there is adequate
                  evidence to suggest that Indigenous, mestizo, and free and
                  enslaved African men also contributed to production.
                  Franciscan historian Jerónimo de Mendieta (1525–1604), in his
                  book <em>Historia eclesiástica indiana</em> (1595), documents
                  Indigenous expertise in pottery and their eventual mastery of
                  glazing techniques introduced by Spanish craftsmen. He wrote:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    [The Indigenous] were masters of pottery and clay hollowware
                    for eating and drinking. Their pottery was finely painted
                    and well made. And although they were not familiar with
                    glazing, they learned this process later from the first
                    masters who arrived from Spain, no matter how much he
                    guarded and protected it from them.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-04mcquade-essay-fn12" id="page-04mcquade-essay-fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  In 1579, Gerónimo Pérez de Salazar agreed to finance the
                  opening of the ceramic workshop of Antonio Xinovés and “feed
                  Xinovés, the other journeymen, and the Indians employed.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-04mcquade-essay-fn13" id="page-04mcquade-essay-fnref13" class="footnote-ref-anchor">13</a></sup>
                  Other examples support the presence of Indigenous men employed
                  by workshops; however, because they were barred from taking
                  the exam required to become master potters, they were unable
                  to move beyond the role of journeyman. Thus, regardless of
                  proficiency, racial restrictions limited advancement for many
                  potters. Mestizo potters were, however, ultimately permitted
                  to rise to the rank of master potter, such as Francisco
                  Martín, who had worked since 1666 on the street of Traje de la
                  Santa Iglesia Catedral.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-04mcquade-essay-fn14" id="page-04mcquade-essay-fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  One of the earliest documented potters in Puebla, Gaspar de
                  Encinas (ca. 1537–1619), migrated from Seville, Spain, and
                  established a workshop near the cathedral on Calle los
                  Herreros. Born in Seville around 1537, Encinas married María
                  Gaitan from Talavera de la Reina, and they had four sons
                  before he departed for Mexico without his family between 1587
                  and 1590. Encinas had worked in Talavera de la Reina before
                  moving to New Spain. In New Spain, Encinas produced ceramic
                  tableware, water pipes, and likely the first glazed tiles. In
                  1602, he received a commission to produce tiles for the first
                  cathedral of Mexico City.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-04mcquade-essay-fn15" id="page-04mcquade-essay-fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Mexican historian Guillermo Tovar de Teresa attributed to
                  Encinas two rare basins with a lace design in monochrome
                  manganese that he acquired from the Pérez de Salazar
                  collection (one is illustrated in fig. 3).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-04mcquade-essay-fn16" id="page-04mcquade-essay-fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup>
                  As the decoration likely originated in Talavera de la Reina,
                  it was more likely Encinas’s son, Gaspar Encinas, el mozo, who
                  introduced the lace design to Puebla as the style of
                  decoration had not yet been developed before Encinas, el
                  viejo, left for New Spain.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-04mcquade-essay-fn17" id="page-04mcquade-essay-fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup>
                  Encinas, el mozo, came to Puebla from Talavera de la Reina
                  with his mother at the very end of the sixteenth century,
                  along with a number of supplies his father had requested.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-04mcquade-essay-fn18" id="page-04mcquade-essay-fnref18" class="footnote-ref-anchor">18</a></sup>
                  Once settled in Puebla, he continued the family tradition by
                  becoming a master potter. A document from 1619 indicates that
                  he and his second wife, Ursula de Espindola, lived on Calle
                  los Mesones, where they kept a store.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-04mcquade-essay-fn19" id="page-04mcquade-essay-fnref19" class="footnote-ref-anchor">19</a></sup>

                  Despite the strong resemblance to the lace design from
                  Talavera de la Reina, the decoration of the Puebla basin also
                  evokes its local manufacture with an image of a
                  <em>guajolote</em> (Mexican turkey) at the center.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-04mcquade-essay-fn20" id="page-04mcquade-essay-fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup>
                  The lace decoration evolved significantly from its Spanish
                  roots by the mid-seventeenth century, introducing cobalt and
                  reimagined to create a web-like pattern. To archaeologists,
                  this decoration is referred to as Puebla Polychrome,
                  characterized by its cobalt-blue-and-manganese design.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-04mcquade-essay-fn21" id="page-04mcquade-essay-fnref21" class="footnote-ref-anchor">21</a></sup>
                  While intact pieces from the seventeenth century are rare, the
                  number of fragments found in archaeological excavations in
                  Central America, the Caribbean, Georgia, Florida, and New
                  Mexico suggest that it enjoyed a wide appeal.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-04mcquade-essay-fn22" id="page-04mcquade-essay-fnref22" class="footnote-ref-anchor">22</a></sup>
                  A rare extant example from The Metropolitan Museum of Art
                  includes an inscription: “I am for washing the purificators
                  and nothing else” (<em>Soy para labar los puryfycadores y no más</em>), indicating that it was made for washing the altar napkin
                  used to clean the chalice following communion (fig. 4). On the
                  outer wall of the vessel appears the letter “A,” referencing a
                  potter’s mark that was required by all master potters (fig.
                  5). Without the existence of a ledger or document correlating
                  the mark to a specific potter or workshop, we must rely on the
                  names we find in historic records that correspond to the dates
                  identified by archaeologists, which for this design span from
                  approximately 1650 to 1680. Using those dates, we may surmise
                  that the mark “A” may be associated with the workshop of
                  Domingo de Aguilar, Jose Anaya, or Antonio de Arteaga, all of
                  whom were master potters from the early to mid-seventeenth

                  The “A” mark also appears on another type of tin-glazed
                  earthenware from Puebla known as Abo Polychrome, which has a
                  distinct combination of orange, yellow, green, and manganese
                  thin lines (fig. 6).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-04mcquade-essay-fn24" id="page-04mcquade-essay-fnref24" class="footnote-ref-anchor">24</a></sup>
                  Abo polychrome is likely the product of a stipulation in the
                  potter ordinances that specifies “in order that there be
                  variety, the other style of decoration for this fine ware
                  shall be in imitation of Talavera [de la Reina] ware or
                  figures and designs in colors shading them with all the five
                  colors used in the art.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-04mcquade-essay-fn25" id="page-04mcquade-essay-fnref25" class="footnote-ref-anchor">25</a></sup>
                  Given the strong correlation to the design tradition of
                  Talavera de la Reina, we might assume that the potter who
                  helped popularize it had worked in Talavera de la Reina or was
                  familiar with the style. Figure 6 is one of the few extant
                  examples. While it is unmarked, it is typical of many of the
                  fragments found with a mark.

                <p>
                  By the mid-seventeenth century, Puebla potters began
                  responding to the increasing demand for vessels inspired by
                  Asian designs as a result of transpacific trade between 1565
                  and 1815 that brought millions of goods from Manila to New
                  Spain—an important topic covered by Diego Javier Luis in this
                  volume.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-04mcquade-essay-fn26" id="page-04mcquade-essay-fnref26" class="footnote-ref-anchor">26</a></sup>
                  This shift likely took place prior to the issuance of
                  amendments to the ordinances in 1682, one of which specified
                  that one of the decorations shall be in “imitation of Chinese
                  ware, very blue, finished in the same style.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-04mcquade-essay-fn27" id="page-04mcquade-essay-fnref27" class="footnote-ref-anchor">27</a></sup>
                  A pair of identical blue-and-white jars marked “he” held by
                  the Hispanic Society Museum &amp; Library (fig. 7) and the
                  Philadelphia Museum of Art represent two of the finest
                  examples of how Puebla potters responded to the growing
                  enthusiasm for Chinese style while also maintaining a unique
                  style of their own. The mark “he” on the lower register has
                  been attributed to master potter Damián Hernández. As a
                  founding member of the potter’s guild and one of its first
                  inspectors, the attribution is logical. Born in Spain,
                  Hernández settled in Puebla at a young age and learned the art
                  of tin-glazed earthenware in Mexico from Antonio de Vega y
                  Córdoba.&nbsp;Hernández’s name appears in documents as early as
                  1607, which suggests that he was older and well-established
                  professionally when he founded the guild with his
                  colleagues.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-04mcquade-essay-fn28" id="page-04mcquade-essay-fnref28" class="footnote-ref-anchor">28</a></sup>
                  The use of blue and white, cloud forms, and male figures with
                  queue hairstyle all characterize the Chinese style. However,
                  the narrative scene better reflects the dramatic festivals
                  that took place in Puebla and other cities, where individuals
                  dressed in costumes from different parts of the world,
                  bullfights took place, and triumphal chariots processed in a
                  theatrical fashion. One such event occurred in 1649 on the
                  occasion of the consecration of the cathedral of Puebla, when
                  people “dressed as Spaniards and Indians of all nations . . .
                  and performed <em>cañas y toros</em> (lance and bullfighting)
                  all ending with the dramatic appearance of a triumphal chariot
                  dedicated to the Immaculate Conception.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-04mcquade-essay-fn29" id="page-04mcquade-essay-fnref29" class="footnote-ref-anchor">29</a></sup>

                  Whether the mark “he” represents Hernández, his workshop, or
                  even another potter altogether, the number of sophisticated
                  examples signed “he” suggest that the production was
                  important.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-04mcquade-essay-fn30" id="page-04mcquade-essay-fnref30" class="footnote-ref-anchor">30</a></sup>
                  A basin from the Franz Mayer Museum (figs. 8 and 9) and a
                  pharmacy jar from The Metropolitan Museum of Art (figs. 10 and
                  11) are among the wide variety of extant pieces marked “he.”
                  The decoration of these and other works fully embraces another
                  article in the 1682 amendment to the ordinances specifying
                  that one decoration shall “be painted in the manner that we
                  call <em>aborronado</em>,” a term used to describe blurred or
                  blotted dots. The jar (fig. 10) is decorated with a density of
                  decoration surrounding a rectangular void for a removeable
                  label or inscription naming the medicinal contents of the jar.
                  Woven within crowded blurred dots and foliage of the basin
                  (fig. 8) appear a quetzal bird and feline, both important
                  animals in Mesoamerican ideology and iconography. It is not
                  known if the image was requested as part of a commission or if
                  it was a subject that the painter was familiar with. It does,
                  however, suggest the influence of Mesoamerican imagery endured
                  through the viceregal period. The use of local and
                  Mesoamerican references appears in other vessels, such as the
                  bird on a cactus popularized on blue-and-white jars from about
                  1700 (fig. 12) and ocelots found on blue-and-white tiles (fig.
                  13).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-04mcquade-essay-fn31" id="page-04mcquade-essay-fnref31" class="footnote-ref-anchor">31</a></sup>

                  Of all the marks known today, “C.S.” is one found most
                  frequently on blue-and-white Puebla pottery from the viceregal
                  period (figs. 14 and 15). Edwin Atlee Barber, former director
                  of the Philadelphia Museum and School of Industrial Art
                  (present-day Philadelphia Museum of Art), attributed the mark
                  to Diego Salvador Carreto, who was active in 1649 and died
                  between 1670 and 1671, and like Hernández was one of the
                  founders of the potters’ guild.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-04mcquade-essay-fn32" id="page-04mcquade-essay-fnref32" class="footnote-ref-anchor">32</a></sup>
                  While the attribution is a logical choice given the quality of
                  the pieces and Carreto’s rank in the guild, the letters would
                  then be in reverse order. In current practices, it is not
                  uncommon for workshops to require painters of vessels to sign
                  their initials in reverse, so it is possible that the
                  tradition has been perpetuated over time; however, there is
                  nothing to indicate that this was a common practice during the
                  viceregal period. Another possible attribution is Cristobal
                  Sánchez de Hinojosa, el viejo, who was a master potter
                  documented in 1653.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-04mcquade-essay-fn33" id="page-04mcquade-essay-fnref33" class="footnote-ref-anchor">33</a></sup>
                  The C.S. mark appears on a wide variety of pieces that span
                  from the mid-seventeenth century through the eighteenth
                  century, which supports the idea that the mark represents a
                  family workshop that continued to use it for generations.

                  The letter “F” is another important mark found on vessels and
                  a series of tiles representing different trades (see fig. 13).
                  These tiles are among the most finely painted works produced
                  in Puebla during the seventeenth century. Not all the tiles
                  from the series have the “F” mark, although the frequency of
                  the mark and the repetition of the scenes suggest that these
                  were produced at the same workshop. There are a number of
                  artists from the last quarter of the seventeenth century whose
                  names contain the letter “F,” such as Juan de la Feria, Luis
                  Fernández Lechuga, and Miguel Fernández Palomino. While the
                  decoration of the tiles is entirely unique, they resemble the
                  style of decoration found in Kraak porcelain from the Ming
                  dynasty (1368–1644)—a style that became increasingly popular
                  among Puebla workshops by the turn of the eighteenth century.
                  An excellent example of this type of design was uncovered from
                  a site excavated during the renovation of the Franz Mayer
                  Museum in Mexico City (fig. 16).

                <p>
                  Master potter Diego de Santa Cruz de Oyanguren y Espinola
                  (also spelled Espindola) was considered one of the most
                  important producers of tin-glazed earthenware during the
                  eighteenth century. Espinola was appointed alcalde of the
                  guild numerous times between 1734 and 1761.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-04mcquade-essay-fn34" id="page-04mcquade-essay-fnref34" class="footnote-ref-anchor">34</a></sup>
                  He was married to Maria de Zayas, whose family had operated a
                  prominent ceramic workshop in Puebla since the seventeenth
                  century (and was mentioned earlier in the text). Like his
                  wife’s family, Espinola became so well known that the street
                  where the workshop was located carried the family name of
                  “street of Espinola” (<em>calle de Espinola</em>). The lawyer
                  to the Royal Audience, Manuel Caro, presented Espinola to the
                  viceroy in 1762 as having “invented” the Chinese style in
                  Puebla.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-04mcquade-essay-fn35" id="page-04mcquade-essay-fnref35" class="footnote-ref-anchor">35</a></sup>
                  He continued to promote Espinola by boasting that “most
                  experts were not able to distinguish his work from that of
                  China or Japan” and that his ware was “not only the most
                  polished but also the most durable.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-04mcquade-essay-fn36" id="page-04mcquade-essay-fnref36" class="footnote-ref-anchor">36</a></sup>
                  Depending on how one defines the “Chinese style,” it is
                  unlikely that Espinola invented it in Puebla; however, he and
                  his workshop certainly may have specialized in the decoration.
                  A late-eighteenth-century or early-nineteenth-century plate
                  signed “Espindola” on the back suggests that the workshop was
                  in operation for multiple generations.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-04mcquade-essay-fn37" id="page-04mcquade-essay-fnref37" class="footnote-ref-anchor">37</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1813, a new constitution for the Spanish empire,
                  promulgated by an anti-monarchical assembly at Cádiz,
                  eradicated the potter’s guild and revoked the ordinances.
                  Mexican ceramicists were free to create new styles of their
                  own, but the lack of regulations led to a decline in the
                  quality for which Puebla potters were known. Also at this
                  time, workshops in other parts of Mexico began producing less
                  expensive alternatives. The lifting of import restrictions
                  allowed for a variety of European ceramic types to enter New
                  Spain. The demand for Asian-style pottery declined alongside
                  the weakening of transpacific trade, which ultimately ended in
                  1815, just as independence movements were emerging in the
                  Americas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Despite numerous attempts by the guild to require master
                  potters to mark their work, most of the extant viceregal
                  vessels remain without a mark, leaving much of Puebla’s
                  ceramic history anonymous. This may have been the result of
                  market constraints during the viceregal period as the demand
                  for ceramic ware grew and the guild’s rigid regulations became
                  increasingly difficult to enforce, particularly concerning the
                  exclusive right of master potters to use costly cobalt blue.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The success of Puebla’s ceramic production beginning in the
                  viceregal period is a testament to the city’s role as a major
                  center of artistic and commercial exchange. While the potters’
                  guild established strict regulations to maintain quality and
                  control production, the anonymity of many artisans—due in part
                  to social hierarchies and guild restrictions—has left gaps in
                  our understanding of individual contributions. The marks that
                  do exist provide crucial insights into the workshops and
                  stylistic evolution of Puebla’s ceramics, but they represent
                  only a fraction of the story. For example, marks are typically
                  signed by the painter of the vessels and most workshops
                  involve specialists for each area of production. The
                  dissolution of the guild in the early nineteenth century led
                  to both artistic liberation and a decline in the standardized
                  quality that had defined Puebla pottery for centuries.
                  Nevertheless, the tradition adapted and endured. The revival
                  efforts of the late nineteenth and early twentieth
                  centuries—with potters such as Ysauro Uriarte Martínez,
                  Enrique Luis Ventosa, J. Miguel Martínez, Antonio Espinosa,
                  and Pedro Padierna—had a lasting impact on the regrowth of the
                  industry and development into new directions that would
                  ultimately lead to the enforcement of new authenticity
                  standards and establishment of the trademark of the term
                  “talavera.” By reassessing the historical record and
                  recognizing the collaborative nature of these workshops, we
                  gain a deeper appreciation for the artistry, labor, and
                  cultural significance embedded in Puebla’s famed pottery.
                  Today, potters continue to draw inspiration from historical
                  forms while innovating within the medium to create unique
                  works of art. This has ensured that the legacy of Puebla’s
                  potters remains a vital part of the city’s heritage.

                        This tradition takes its name from Talavera de la Reina,
                        a city in central Spain where many of Puebla’s first
                        potters originated. The term
                        <em>talavera</em> eventually became synonymous for the

                  On March 3, 1653, a celebrated image of the ecce homo departed
                  Acapulco for Manila on the galleon
                  <em>San Francisco Xavier</em> in the custody of Augustinian
                  Recollect missionaries. Known as the
                  <em>Christ of Humility</em> <em>and</em> <em>Patience</em>,
                  the sculpture, which was venerated in the monastic church of
                  San Nicolás de Tolentino, was destroyed in the bombardment of
                  Manila in 1945 (fig.1). A prewar photograph preserves a blurry
                  record of its appearance, but early written sources vividly
                  describe it as a life-size image of the scourged and
                  humiliated Christ, crowned with thorns and holding a reed
                  scepter (fig. 2).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn1" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                  Official histories of the Recollects narrate the story of its
                  origin, its translation from Mexico City to Manila, and its
                  festive reception there in mid-October 1653.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn2" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                  Chronicles and eye-witness reports by members of other
                  religious orders corroborate many details of the sculpture’s
                  history.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn3" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                  While the documentary and explanatory value of these sources
                  is considerable, they are far from neutral. Recognition of the
                  aims and biases of those who recorded the details amassed in
                  this case study is crucial, not only in the interest of
                  objectivity but because it illuminates attitudes toward the
                  making, use, and mutable resonances of sacred images in
                  movement. The first objective of this investigation is to
                  document the existence of a sculpture sent from New Spain to
                  the Philippines in the mid-seventeenth century and the second
                  is to reconstruct its context to understand how it functioned
                  in the practice of belief under circumstances described by
                  contemporaries as both miserable and calamitous. The analysis
                  of written sources foregrounds the contention that a sacred
                  image made in Mexico City had the capacity to console a
                  divinely castigated community on the other side of the world.

                  The principal sources for this study are histories of the
                  Order of Augustinian Recollects, also known as “Discalced or
                  Unshod Augustinians,” a Spanish mendicant reform order that
                  sought a return to the primitive observance of the Rule of St.

                  The Recollects were one of the last orders established in the
                  Philippines, where they were instrumental in efforts to reform
                  the regular Augustinians, who were implicated in a series of
                  scandals. The first mission arrived there in 1606.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn5" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>

                  <em>Fray</em> Diego de Santa Teresa published an extended
                  version of the origin story of the <em>Ecce homo</em> in 1743,
                  writing that it was made for Juan de Araus, a Mexico City
                  priest who sought a representation of Christ’s humility and
                  patience to help subdue his fiery disposition (fig. 3).
                  According to Santa Teresa, Araus commissioned the image from
                  an unnamed sculptor whom he described as “a most exquisite and
                  devout Artist” (<em>un Artífice primorossimo, y devoto</em>).
                  In advance of making the image, both the priest and the artist
                  prepared themselves through prayer and fasting. For the three
                  years during which the work was in progress, they were
                  sustained by frequent Communion, readings from the Gospel, and
                  contemplation of the works of Christian mystics, including St.
                  Gertrude and St. Bridget of Sweden. The chronicler also
                  specifies that the material used to make the image is
                  <em>pasto</em>, likely cornstalk paste (<em>caña de maíz</em>), a lightweight material well-suited to processional images.
                  He goes on to describe an improbable artistic process of
                  “adding and taking away” until it was finished to the priest’s
                  liking. Araus venerated the image on an altar in his private
                  quarters until fray Jacinto de San Fulgencio, en route to the
                  Philippines with twenty-four Augustinian Recollect
                  missionaries, asked him to give it up “for the consolation of
                  Manila.” After his initial refusal to part with the image,
                  Araus was stricken with unbearable pain, relieved only when he
                  reversed his decision.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn6" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>
                  The calamitous state of Manila, ruined by natural disasters,
                  conflict, and economic collapse, called for both material and
                  spiritual remedies. The inference was that an image of Christ
                  in an attitude of patient submission to his torments could aid
                  the city’s beleaguered residents.

                  This origin story is largely invented, but key details can be
                  confirmed through other sources. Juan de Araus was indeed a
                  priest of the parish church of Santa Catarina Mártir in Mexico
                  City. He was a benefactor and <em>hermano mayor</em> of the
                  Augustinian Recollects, and his gift of the image to the
                  Manila mission is recorded in other sources.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn7" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>
                  His allegedly passionate temperament, which led to “grave
                  encounters with the powerful,” is consistent with accounts of
                  his involvement in a bitter dispute over the administration of
                  the Recollect Hospice in Mexico City, a clash in which fray
                  Jacinto de San Fulgencio was also implicated.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn8" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>
                  The Recollect friar had traveled to Spain in 1649 as a
                  delegate (<em>comisario</em>) of the Philippine province to
                  recruit missionaries and secure royal financing. He returned
                  in the spring of 1652, encountering Araus in Mexico City on
                  his way to Acapulco, where he embarked for Manila a year
                  later, in 1653.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn9" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>

                <p>
                  Even though not every detail of Santa Teresa’s story is
                  credible, it is nonetheless consistent with prevailing
                  attitudes toward the making of sacred images. That is, the
                  sacred resides in images made by devout artists, inspired by
                  prayers, penances, and spiritual exercises. In his account of
                  the making of the image of Christ, Santa Teresa specifically
                  references the writings of St. Gertrude and St. Bridget of
                  Sweden, whose vivid revelations of Christ’s suffering have
                  long been recognized as sources for visual representations of
                  the Passion.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn10" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup>
                  What is most striking about the friar’s account, however, is
                  its emphasis on the spiritual preparation required for the
                  making of a “devout” image imbued with the quality of
                  sacredness or divinity. That the preparatory exercise is
                  jointly undertaken by the priest and the artist recalls other
                  histories of sacred images, such as a copy of
                  <em>Nuestra Señora de la Soledad</em> carved by Gaspar
                  Becerra, who was aided by the prayers, alms, and penances of
                  Minim friars in Madrid.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn11" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup>
                  In a similar story, Mariana de San José, founder of the
                  Augustinian Recollect order of nuns, commissioned a sculpture
                  of Christ at the Column for her convent and stipulated that
                  the artist should commence work on it while the nuns received
                  Communion in order to ensure that the image was especially
                  devout.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn12" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup>

                <p>
                  Early written sources consistently refer to the Manila image
                  as an ecce homo, although it was properly known as the
                  <em>Christ of Humility and Patience</em>. In 1664, the
                  Recollect chronicler Andrés de San Nicolás referred to it by
                  that name and declared that it was one of the most venerated
                  images in the islands. He described it as life-size and
                  praised its manufacture as the “best that is known in those
                  distant hemispheres.” The image of Christ, seated on a stone
                  and resting his hand on his cheek, he wrote, “moved the hard
                  heart of the most lost to trembling and devotion.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn13" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref13" class="footnote-ref-anchor">13</a></sup>
                  In 1743, Diego de Santa Teresa elaborated on its appearance:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    The Holy Image is the natural size of a man; represented
                    seated on a pedestal; his entire body is purple, signifying
                    the cruel lashes he suffered because of the human race: His
                    cheek rests on his right hand, his head tilted, and his body
                    slightly turned to one side, so that his shoulders show many
                    pitiful wounds; he is crowned with very thick, woven rushes;
                    and in his left hand he holds the reed cane. The eyes, which
                    are beautiful, seem to weep and gaze in all directions. The
                    physique and symmetry of the body are most perfect, with
                    every part a sum of beauties; and the hearts of those who
                    look at it are moved to pity, even those who are adorned
                    with diamonds.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn14" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup>

                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Augustinian Recollect writers were not the only ones to
                  describe the image, although others focus less on its visual
                  appearance than on subjective responses to it. The Dominican
                  friar Domingo Fernández de Navarrete saw the image in the
                  1650s and wrote that it “moves all who see it to pious
                  compassion.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn15" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup>
                  In 1660, Alonso del Valle wrote that it was “the living
                  impression of the scandals of Jerusalem . . . the sculpted

                  The subject of Christ’s humility, with its emphasis on quiet
                  self-negation, was eminently suited to the mental prayer
                  methods of the Recollects, but devotion to the ecce homo was
                  prevalent throughout the Spanish world. The most notable
                  example in Mexico City is the so-called
                  <em>Señor del Cacao</em>, a life-size image venerated in the
                  Metropolitan Cathedral (fig. 4). Like the Manila
                  <em>Christ of Humility</em>, it is made of cornstalk
                  paste.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn17" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup>
                  The fabrication of the Manila image in paste as an episode
                  (<em>de pasto en un passo</em>) representing Christ’s humility
                  is stipulated by Santa Teresa and points to its having been
                  conceived from the outset for processional use.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn18" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref18" class="footnote-ref-anchor">18</a></sup>

                <p>
                  In the early spring of 1653, after overwintering in Acapulco,
                  the nine-hundred-ton galleon
                  <em>San Francisco Xavier</em> prepared to depart for Manila
                  with six hundred passengers, silver to sustain the colony and
                  exchange for merchandise, dispatches and correspondence, trade
                  goods, and personal belongings. The ship’s cargo included the
                  image of Christ given to the Augustinian Recollects by Juan de
                  Araus as well as a number of other works of art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn20" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup>
                  Passengers included many high-ranking officials and clerics,
                  including Sabiniano Manrique de Lara (1609–1679), the new
                  governor and captain general of the Philippines, and Miguel de
                  Poblete (1602–1667), the incoming archbishop. Other passengers
                  included an infantry company of one hundred soldiers and fifty
                  Augustinian and Jesuit missionaries.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn21" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref21" class="footnote-ref-anchor">21</a></sup>
                  The new governor-general, Manrique de Lara, was a Knight of
                  Santiago descended from a noble family of Málaga. His military
                  career included five years of imprisonment in Portugal
                  following the dissolution of the Iberian union in 1640. After
                  his release, he was made <em>castellan</em> of the fortress
                  that guarded the Port of Acapulco. He was the highest
                  authority of the port, in charge of receiving and dispatching
                  the Manila galleons and overseeing the fair where imported
                  merchandise was traded.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn22" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref22" class="footnote-ref-anchor">22</a></sup>
                  After being named governor of the Philippines in June 1651,
                  Manrique de Lara left Acapulco for Mexico City, where he spent
                  the next two years making preparations and procuring funds for
                  the journey to Manila, which was delayed until March 1653 for
                  lack of a ship to transport him.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn23" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref23" class="footnote-ref-anchor">23</a></sup>
                  Poblete, born in Mexico, was the first creole archbishop of
                  Manila, a post to which he was named in 1647. He was not
                  consecrated until 1650 and did not take possession of the seat
                  until his arrival in Manila in 1653.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn24" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref24" class="footnote-ref-anchor">24</a></sup>
                  Poblete had previously been <em>maestrescuela</em> of Puebla

                <p>
                  While passengers waited to depart for Manila, the image of
                  <em>Christ of Humility</em> was venerated in the Acapulco
                  parish church of San Pablo. On March 2, 1653, the afternoon
                  prior to their embarkation, the Recollects, accompanied by the
                  governor, archbishop, missionaries, and townspeople, carried
                  the <em>Christ of Humility</em> in procession to the beach,
                  where it was received with artillery salvos and then loaded
                  onto the ship. During the transpacific crossing—a journey of
                  almost five months—the image of Christ was used to arouse the
                  devotion of passengers and petition for divine aid and
                  protection. By the time the ship arrived in Manila, it had
                  already been acclaimed as a miracle-worker, credited with
                  curing gravely ill passengers and rescuing the ship from
                  violent storms. According to Diego de Santa Teresa: “They put
                  it on board the ship <em>San Francisco Xavier</em>, in a place
                  where everyone could have it in their presence and ask it for
                  help from the recurring perils of the waves; which they did,
                  with many pious petitions and fervent novenas.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn26" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref26" class="footnote-ref-anchor">26</a></sup>
                  The same missionaries, on the transatlantic leg of their
                  journey, had performed spiritual exercises as if they were in
                  their convent. They preached in the afternoons, persuaded
                  sailors to pray the rosary, gave the Sacrament of Penance to
                  sinners, and provided instruction in Christian doctrine.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn27" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref27" class="footnote-ref-anchor">27</a></sup>
                  The ship’s transformation into a place of worship and
                  religious instruction is a recurring theme in histories of
                  religious orders with overseas missions.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn28" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref28" class="footnote-ref-anchor">28</a></sup>
                  While it attests to actual religious practice, the
                  chronicler’s narrative is also informed by Christian
                  allegories of the Ship of the Church, endangered by demons and
                  tempests. In a late seventeenth-century Hispano-Philippine
                  ivory, the Ship of Religion is rowed by members of religious
                  orders (three friars and a Jesuit), whose labors propel it
                  through dangerous waters toward the safe harbor of Salvation
                  (fig. 5).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn29" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref29" class="footnote-ref-anchor">29</a></sup>
                  The Cross serves as the ship’s mast, and symbols of the
                  Passion emblazon the pennant and sail. The Virgin Mary, her
                  head encircled by a radiant halo and her heart pierced by the
                  sword of sorrow, is a passenger.

                  Sacred images often aided religious practices and rituals
                  intended to assure the safe passage of ships, and passengers
                  on the Manila-bound galleon in the spring of 1653 were
                  accompanied by at least two:
                  <em>Christ of Humility and Patience</em> and
                  <em>Our Lady of Good Voyage and Peace</em> (also known as
                  <em>Our Lady of Antipolo</em>) (fig. 6). According to the
                  Jesuit chronicler Diego de Oña, the image of Christ was placed
                  next to that of his mother on the ship, and under their watch,
                  there was nothing to fear.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn30" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref30" class="footnote-ref-anchor">30</a></sup>
                  The latter image is said to have come from a church in
                  Acapulco, where Juan Niño de Tavora, governor-elect of the
                  Philippines, encountered it in 1626 and took it with him to
                  Manila. The diminutive image of the Virgin Mary protected that
                  galleon during the transpacific crossing, and the grateful
                  governor gave it to the Jesuits for their church in Antipolo
                  (in the mountains east of Manila). After miraculously escaping
                  destruction during the <em>sangley</em> uprising of 1639, the
                  image was taken to Manila’s Royal Chapel. In 1646, it was
                  moved to Cavite, Manila’s harbor, to safeguard the city from
                  Dutch attacks. The image purportedly crossed the Pacific eight
                  times as protectress of the galleon. In gratitude for the safe
                  arrival of the <em>San Francisco Xavier</em> in 1653, the
                  incoming governor and archbishop vowed to restore the Virgin
                  to her church in Antipolo and bestowed the title
                  <em>Nuestra Señora de la Paz y Buen Viaje</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn31" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref31" class="footnote-ref-anchor">31</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  On June 26, after almost four months on the open sea, the
                  <em>San Francisco Xavier</em> entered the waters of the
                  Philippine archipelago through the Strait of San Bernardino.
                  Up to this point, the voyage had been miraculously uneventful.
                  Diego de Oña observed that only three passengers had died en
                  route and took it as a sign that the ship brought good health
                  to the islands. He attributed the successful voyage to higher
                  causes, specifically to “God made human, adored in a most
                  tender image of the ecce homo, a precious treasure brought by
                  the Recollect fathers for their church, and his Holy Mother,
                  adored in the admirable image of Antipolo.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn32" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref32" class="footnote-ref-anchor">32</a></sup>
                  The ship was nearly lost before reaching Manila, but on July
                  23, it cast anchor at Cavite, the first Spanish vessel to do
                  so in fourteen years.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn33" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref33" class="footnote-ref-anchor">33</a></sup>
                  The significance of the occasion was accentuated by the fact
                  that Cavite had ceased to be the principal port of the
                  archipelago during the 1640s, as the galleon was diverted to
                  Lampón (Lamon Bay) to avoid the Dutch blockade.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn34" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref34" class="footnote-ref-anchor">34</a></sup>
                  The governor and the archbishop disembarked the day before,
                  and on the beach, Poblete blessed the land and then blessed
                  Manrique de Lara, who had symbolically ceded primacy to him
                  (and to the Church) in the act.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn35" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref35" class="footnote-ref-anchor">35</a></sup>
                  This was the first in a series of public acts, both civil and
                  religious, that followed the arrival of the galleon. The
                  archbishop and governor, as heads of church and state, made
                  public entries into the city of Manila on July 24 and 25. The
                  splendor of these events (which the city could ill afford)
                  confirmed the power and continuity of the Spanish monarchy and
                  the Catholic church in a distant city imperiled by acute
                  political, economic, and spiritual crises.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn36" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref36" class="footnote-ref-anchor">36</a></sup>
                  The public spectacle of Manrique de Lara’s entry stood in
                  stark contrast to his own assessment of the dire situation on
                  taking possession of the government. In a report to King
                  Philip IV, he wrote, “I found these islands in a miserable
                  state and in their final gasp.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn37" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref37" class="footnote-ref-anchor">37</a></sup>
                  At the time of Poblete’s entry, the episcopal seat of Manila
                  had been vacant for twelve years. His predecessor, Hernando
                  Guerrero, who was banished from Manila by the governor in
                  1636, died in 1641; his would-be predecessor, Fernando Montero
                  de Espinosa, died en route to Manila and entered the city in
                  1645 as a cadaver.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn38" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref38" class="footnote-ref-anchor">38</a></sup>
                  The exile of Archbishop Guerrero was pinpointed by some
                  chroniclers as the shameful cause of Manila’s castigation by
                  God.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn39" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref39" class="footnote-ref-anchor">39</a></sup>
                  Archbishop Poblete delivered a remedy in the form of a papal
                  brief by Innocent X absolving inhabitants of the Philippines
                  of their sins and conceding plenary indulgences to those who
                  sincerely confessed them.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn40" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref40" class="footnote-ref-anchor">40</a></sup>

                <p>
                  On arrival in Manila, the <em>Christ of Humility</em> was
                  initially taken to the monastic church of St. John the Baptist
                  in Bagumbayan, located just outside the city walls. The
                  monastery was the first one established by the Recollects in
                  the Philippines.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn41" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref41" class="footnote-ref-anchor">41</a></sup>
                  The miracle-working image was placed on an altar, where it
                  attracted the devotion of the local community and that of the
                  governor and archbishop, who were said to have visited it
                  daily in gratitude for their safe passage from Acapulco.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn42" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref42" class="footnote-ref-anchor">42</a></sup>
                  It remained in Bagumbayan for almost three months, until it
                  was carried in procession to its permanent location in the
                  <em>intramuros</em> church of San Nicolás de Tolentino, the
                  Recollect Province’s patron saint. The church was newly
                  rebuilt, having collapsed in the earthquake of 1645.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn43" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref43" class="footnote-ref-anchor">43</a></sup>
                  On October 16, the governor prayed an all-night vigil in the
                  Bagumbayan church and the next morning received the Sacrament
                  of Penance. Festivities continued with dancing, artillery
                  salvos, and the gunfire of both Native and Spanish militias.
                  On October 18, the image was carried beneath a canopy of
                  branches in a solemn procession led by the archbishop to the
                  church of the Misericordia (which served as a provisional
                  cathedral). The next morning, the Recollect fathers carried it
                  on their shoulders in procession to the church of San Nicolás
                  and placed it on a side altar.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn44" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref44" class="footnote-ref-anchor">44</a></sup>
                  There, the image became the focus of the daily devotions of
                  the governor, whose public displays of piety were praised by
                  chroniclers and emulated by other worshippers (fig. 7).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn45" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref45" class="footnote-ref-anchor">45</a></sup>
                  The eighteenth-century Recollect historian Juan de la
                  Concepción observed that, following the governor’s example,
                  devotion to the <em>Christ of Humility</em> was universal, and
                  feasts were celebrated annually with costly brilliance. In his
                  own time, he noted that “this fervor has greatly diminished;
                  fashion also has its use in devotions, and the most flamboyant
                  ones attract attention.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn46" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref46" class="footnote-ref-anchor">46</a></sup>
                  Indeed, the image with the most prominent cult in the church
                  of San Nicolás was not the <em>Christ of Humility</em>, but
                  <em>Christ the Nazarene</em>, said to have been brought from
                  New Spain to the Philippines in 1606 by the first Augustinian
                  Recollects. The San Nicolás–based confraternity of
                  <em>Nazarenos</em> carried it in procession on Holy Thursday,
                  taking it out at midnight, and on Holy Monday, in the
                  afternoon.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn47" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref47" class="footnote-ref-anchor">47</a></sup>
                  The <em>Ecce homo</em> was the focus of passional devotion on
                  Good Friday, but in a measure adopted by the provincial
                  chapter in 1663, the <em>Nazarenos</em> were forbidden to
                  carry it in processions except in the case of “most urgent
                  necessity.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn48" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref48" class="footnote-ref-anchor">48</a></sup>
                  The injunction points to the use of the image in Rogation
                  processions in connection with extraordinary emergencies and
                  calamities, such as those organized during the previous year,
                  when the city was threatened by the Chinese archpirate Zheng
                  Chenggong (known to the Spanish as Koxinga).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn49" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref49" class="footnote-ref-anchor">49</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p><strong>Calamity and Consolation</strong></p>
                <p>
                  In 1654, on assuming his duties as the new governor of the
                  Philippines, Manrique de Lara reported to Philip IV that he
                  found the islands “in tears from calamities and miseries.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn50" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref50" class="footnote-ref-anchor">50</a></sup>
                  Another informant, Magino Sola, the Jesuit Procurator General
                  of the Philippines, contrasted Manila’s former splendor with
                  its current ruin: “Today you look so abused, so oppressed, so
                  poor, and so lacking in the strength you used to have, that if
                  you once had enough to aid and enrich other kingdoms, today
                  you do not have enough to sustain yourself . . . with reason
                  then you weep over so many calamities, so many misfortunes,
                  and so much poverty.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn51" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref51" class="footnote-ref-anchor">51</a></sup>
                  The catastrophic earthquake that occurred on November 30,
                  1645, during the feast of San Andrés, patron saint of the
                  city, was of such magnitude that it caused the literal
                  collapse of the city. Most of the city’s principal buildings
                  were destroyed or badly damaged, including the cathedral,
                  governor’s palace, Real Audiencia, <em>colegio</em> of Santo
                  Tomás, and the convents of Santo Domingo and San Nicolás de
                  Tolentino. According to one eye-witness report, “Only a shadow
                  of Manila remained.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn52" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref52" class="footnote-ref-anchor">52</a></sup>
                  Bleak assessments detailing Manila’s misfortunes and
                  miseries—conflict, earthquakes, typhoons, shipwrecks,
                  epidemics—routinely attributed them to God’s displeasure with
                  its sinful populace, likening it to the biblical city of
                  Nineveh.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn53" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref53" class="footnote-ref-anchor">53</a></sup>

                <p>
                  Descriptions of Manila in which colonial officials and clerics
                  describe the city’s degraded situation have no visual
                  equivalents, with the possible exception of a seemingly serene
                  view of Manila attributed to the Amsterdam cartographer
                  Johannes Vingboons (1616/17–1670) (fig. 8). The scene includes
                  a blockade fleet of Dutch ships at the entrance to Manila
                  harbor. Dutch harassment of Spanish shipping, which culminated
                  in attacks on Manila in 1646 and 1647, sparked a severe
                  economic crisis, exacerbated by a series of maritime disasters
                  that disrupted the provision of an already inadequate
                  <em>situado</em> or <em>socorro</em>—the financial subsidy
                  sent from New Spain to maintain the colony.

                  The Dutch were not the only threat faced by the Spanish in the
                  Philippines. Other external threats included ongoing
                  confrontations with regional sultanates (called
                  <em>moros</em> by the Spanish) and the danger posed by Chinese
                  and Japanese piracy. Internally, dependence upon and distrust
                  of the large Chinese population of the Parián (so-called
                  sangleyes) hastened violent uprisings and brutal repression in
                  1603, 1639, and 1662.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn54" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref54" class="footnote-ref-anchor">54</a></sup>
                  The looming threat of an attack by Koxinga, whose demand for
                  tribute was refused in 1662, provoked panic and interethnic
                  violence in Manila. Rumors of sangley collusion with the
                  Chinese underlie a miracle story in which a surprise attack
                  was thwarted by Manrique de Lara thanks to warnings
                  communicated by the <em>Christ of Humility</em>. According to
                  Juan de la Concepción, a message was found at the feet of the
                  image: “Governor, take care of your city, they want to
                  surprise you.” The next day a more explicit message was
                  discovered in the same place: “Governor, take care of your
                  city, remove the scaffolding from the walls, do not trust
                  anyone, you have enemies very near.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn55" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref55" class="footnote-ref-anchor">55</a></sup>
                  According to the story, Manrique de Lara promptly removed
                  scaffolding that could have aided seditious sangleyes in
                  scaling the city walls. In fact, the threat of imminent attack
                  did cause the governor to strengthen the city’s fortifications
                  and demolish buildings outside the walls, including churches
                  and convents, that were close enough to serve as enemy
                  positions.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn56" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref56" class="footnote-ref-anchor">56</a></sup>
                  These defensive measures proved unnecessary when Koxinga died
                  unexpectedly. Manrique de Lara evoked Celtiberian resistance
                  to Roman conquest when he reported that “if the barbarian had
                  not died nothing would have remained of we Spanish who
                  inhabited the Philippines but memories, like those of
                  Numancia.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn57" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref57" class="footnote-ref-anchor">57</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Manrique de Lara’s personal devotion to the
                  <em>Christ of Humility</em> is routinely cited by witnesses
                  and repeated by later sources. By all accounts, the governor
                  was genuinely devout, but his public acts of atonement and
                  reparation were manifestly performative ones, enacted as the
                  representative of a distant Catholic monarch. Military
                  chaplain Alonso del Valle vividly recounted one such act in a
                  festival book commemorating celebrations in Manila of the
                  birth of Felipe Próspero (1657–1661).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn58" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref58" class="footnote-ref-anchor">58</a></sup>
                  In August 1659, the galleon from Acapulco brought news of the
                  long-awaited birth of an heir to the Spanish throne, assuring
                  the continuity of the monarchy at a critical moment in the
                  Philippines. The short-lived prince was born in Madrid in
                  November 1657, almost two years before reports reached Manila.
                  Church bells announced the news in Manila, followed by the
                  celebration of a Mass in the Royal Chapel. Twenty days of
                  festivities followed, with both solemn and joyful proceedings,
                  including sermons and processions, as well as bullfights, mock
                  jousts, and fireworks.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn59" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref59" class="footnote-ref-anchor">59</a></sup>
                  On the day the governor received the news, he rushed by
                  carriage to the church of San Nicolás, where he humbled
                  himself before the image of Christ and gave thanks to “the
                  daily guarantor of his government.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn60" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref60" class="footnote-ref-anchor">60</a></sup>
                  According to Alonso del Valle:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    Prostrate, he gave thanks to the holy <em>Ecce homo</em>;
                    miraculous carved figure of devotion, living impression of
                    the scandals of Jerusalem, exact image of the painful
                    sorrows of the Just, sculpted consolation of the sinner’s
                    afflicted tears. To this celestial wonder of earth, which he
                    reverently visits every day, to whom he commends the
                    discreet prayers of human error, with whom he sweetens the
                    bitterness of high command, from whom he recognizes the
                    advent of mild successes, he made exemplary sacrifice of his
                    joys in order to guarantee the credit of eternal ones in
                    faith.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn61" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref61" class="footnote-ref-anchor">61</a></sup>

                  The burden of the office of governor and captain general of
                  the Islands consoled by a sacred image of Christ is not only
                  an evocative representation, in this case, it is also
                  poignant. Manrique de Lara’s corporeal mortification and
                  performative disengagement from worldly affairs anticipated
                  his actual withdrawal. Initially hailed as “Governador
                  Deseado,” by mid-1656, he had petitioned to be relieved of the
                  post, citing poor health, which he traced to his imprisonment
                  in Portugal and the rigors of Manila’s climate.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn62" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref62" class="footnote-ref-anchor">62</a></sup>
                  He was silent about other tribulations, which only grew worse
                  as he awaited a successor, who was not destined to arrive
                  until 1663.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn63" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref63" class="footnote-ref-anchor">63</a></sup>
                  Manrique de Lara returned to his native Málaga, having
                  renounced its governorship, and became a priest.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn64" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref64" class="footnote-ref-anchor">64</a></sup>

                  The festivities that celebrated the birth of Felipe Próspero
                  in 1659 were staged in a ruined city. The earthquake of 1658
                  had wrecked many of the buildings constructed after the
                  devastation of 1645, including the Recollect church of San
                  Nicolás. When the governor went there after receiving news of
                  the royal birth to prostrate himself in prayer before the
                  <em>Christ of Humility</em>, it was in a provisional church
                  not rebuilt until after 1666.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn65" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref65" class="footnote-ref-anchor">65</a></sup>
                  The ruinous state of the church of San Nicolás, the departure
                  of the governor, and the diminished fortunes of the Recollects
                  in Manila all likely contributed to the waning fervor of
                  devotion to the <em>Christ of Humility and Patience</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn66" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref66" class="footnote-ref-anchor">66</a></sup>
                  At the beginning of the eighteenth century, the Augustinian
                  chronicler Casimiro Díaz observed that the value of the
                  governor’s example was magnified in a land where even
                  devotions were changeable and, like a style of clothing,
                  everyone dressed in what the governor was wearing.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-07kasl-essay-fn67" id="page-07kasl-essay-fnref67" class="footnote-ref-anchor">67</a></sup>
                  During Manrique de Lara’s ten years as governor of the
                  Philippines, religious engagement with Christ’s Passion,
                  aroused by a celebrated image from Mexico, was inextricably
                  bound to a political culture shaped by economic precarity and
                  spiritual crisis. Recognized as a miracle worker from the
                  moment of its transfer to Manila, the image was enshrined on
                  altars and paraded in the streets and plazas of the city in
                  public rituals of salutation, petition, and atonement. These
                  acts of performative piety, whether individual or collective,
                  were also acts of governance that linked the expiation of sin
                  to the consolation and repair of Manila.

                  In 1750, the Dominican Order in the Philippines made an
                  inventory of the many <em>alhajas</em> (religious ornaments)
                  and jewels found in its convent, <em>beaterio</em>, college,
                  and the numerous provincial churches spread across what was
                  then known as the Province of the Holy Rosary (fig. 1).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn1" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                  The inventory extends over more than 150 folios and details
                  the profusion of liturgical silver, religious statuary, and
                  jewelry encrusted with diamonds, rubies, emeralds, sapphires,
                  topazes, and pearls found in these Dominican institutions.
                  Many of the pages are left blank or only partly filled in
                  anticipation of future pious donations, bequests, and
                  purchases that would arrive in coming years to further adorn
                  altarpieces and enhance the Eucharistic experience. While
                  never as wealthy as its Augustinian counterparts, the convent
                  of St. Dominic had among its riches twenty-five lamps and
                  chandeliers, nearly sixty candlesticks, nine chalices, four
                  altar frontals, and eleven crucifixes all wrought in silver
                  and silver-gilt. The jewelry alone went into the hundreds of
                  items. So where did this impressive store of treasure
                  originate?

                  While a significant thread of research in the last few decades
                  has considered the flow of silver into the Philippines, it has
                  focused on the prodigious quantities of coins mined and minted
                  in Mexico or Potosí that found their way into Chinese
                  coffers.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn2" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                  Little has been conducted on the flow of finished silver goods
                  into Manila, nor on local facture in the Philippines, which
                  had a rich tradition of Indigenous goldsmithing and was later
                  home to sangley (Chinese) silversmiths. This, in part, results
                  from the paucity of surviving objects: War, natural disasters,
                  and the vagaries of time have resulted in a small number of
                  colonial art objects in all media—let alone silver, which is
                  both desirable and fungible. During the British occupation of
                  Manila during the Seven Years’ War (1756–63), for example, the
                  defending governor issued a mandate to collect and bury silver
                  ornaments from religious institutions to prevent them from
                  falling into the hands of the invading navy, which would soon
                  go on to capture the silver cache onboard the galleon
                  <em>Santísima Trinidad</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn3" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                  These measures were limited in their success; in October 1762,
                  the British sacked the Dominican church, where they not only
                  looted dozens of silver vessels but also the abundant silver
                  adorning statues like <em>Our Lady of the Rosary</em>, known
                  as <em>La Naval</em>, including her <em>rostrillo</em> (halo
                  or sunburst encircling the face) and gem-studded crown. Not
                  content to simply steal, they desecrated the image, shattering
                  the glass that protected her, cutting off her ivory head and
                  throwing it to the floor, rending her vestments to shreds, and
                  severing the limbs of the Christ Child in her arms. As they
                  rampaged through Manila’s churches, British troops dismantled
                  silver reliquaries, burned nativity scenes, cast the
                  Eucharistic host to the ground, and tied clerical stoles to
                  their horses’ tails.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn4" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                  Crucially, the 1750 inventory allows us to see a snapshot of
                  the order’s silver before these depredations and the equally
                  devastating losses that would come with the Second World
                  War.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn5" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>

                <p>
                  Despite the rapacity with which it was sought after by Spain’s
                  trading partners and political enemies alike, silver objects
                  are less desirable to modern collectors of Filipinana than
                  locally produced ivories and wooden santos. Only two large
                  public collections of silver can be viewed in Manila today:
                  those of the San Agustin and Intramuros museums. Silver
                  maintains a generally fusty reputation. As Helen Hills
                  observes in her work on Neapolitan silver, “Scholarship and
                  gallery displays are overwhelmingly connoisseurial, drily
                  technical, narrowly specialist, and aridly drained of
                  political engagement,” which belies the complex relationship
                  between the cruelty of silver’s extraction and its exalted
                  position as a substance that “bestowed and conveyed immaculacy
                  and polished sophistication.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn6" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>
                  And yet, silver was not simply the fulcrum of global maritime
                  trade but the very stuff of the sacred. On both sides of the
                  Pacific, it was the preferred material for liturgical objects,
                  saints’ reliquaries, and votive offerings. It was the
                  substance from which the infants of Lal-lo (Cagayan) made
                  their first contact with the sacred through the application of
                  holy water from a silver <em>bernegal</em> (drinking vessel)
                  pressed into service as a baptismal shell; it was the same
                  material used to fashion the spectacular, white
                  sapphire-studded armor of
                  <em>Nuestra Señora de la Consolación</em> in the nineteenth
                  century that aided her in her spiritual mission; it was silver
                  that housed a relic of the True Cross in the church of los
                  Santos Reyes del Parián, where it was hoped that this holy
                  shard might inspire Chinese immigrants to adopt the Catholic
                  faith.

                  If, to invoke the words of seventeenth-century Spanish
                  chronicler Juan Grau y Monfalcón, Asian goods were “desired
                  and sought by the rest of the world”—what goods were in turn
                  desired by the Spanish, particularly religious communities,
                  living amongst these immediately available and luxurious
                  export goods?<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn7" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>
                  While the vast majority of cargo on Manila-bound galleons was
                  specie, that is silver <em>reales</em> that could be exchanged
                  for porcelain, silk, ivory, and other fineries, the Spanish
                  also imported gold, olive oil, wine, glass, European clothing
                  and textiles, and art objects. It would seem natural, then,
                  that galleons would also ferry many splendid Mexican and
                  Spanish silverworks bound for Philippine churches: a parallel
                  flow of silver. I had initially hoped to tell a story of
                  silver in Asia as more than a mere commodity and consider
                  artistic influence of the galleon trade that focused on the
                  Philippines rather than Latin America: Mexico in Asia instead
                  of Asia in Mexico. Instead it seems that the landscape is a
                  bit more complicated, especially given the dearth of extant
                  silver objects as well as documents that record them. Despite
                  the difficulty of tracing the course of silver’s importation
                  from abroad, there is a compelling narrative of local creation
                  by sangley artisans to be told.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Silver in the Philippines</strong></p>
                <p>
                  Whether imported as finished objects or, as was more common,
                  wrought locally, silver in the Philippines began its life in
                  the bowels of the Cerro Rico in Potosí or the mountainous
                  regions of Mexico. The quantity of silver mined at Potosí in
                  particular was so immense that chroniclers reported that “it
                  was considered easier and cheaper to arm men and shoe horses
                  with silver than with iron.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn8" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>
                  So too did they describe with openmouthed awe the mind-bending
                  splendor to which this Mexican and Bolivian silver was put for
                  local celebrations: formed into cobblestones for viceregal
                  entries and forged into triumphal arches, images of the
                  Virgin, and miniature silver mountains for religious
                  processions.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn9" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>
                  And yet, <em>potosino</em> silver was famously extracted
                  through a brutal system of forced labor known as the
                  <em>mita</em>. After extraction, silver ore was locally
                  processed through smelting or amalgamation, assayed, and
                  formed into silver bars or minted into coins.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn10" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup>
                  It was then transported to various artistic centers where it
                  was worked by <em>plateros</em> who forged it into objects
                  both sacred and profane, from processional crosses and
                  chalices to inkstands and chamber pots. In the process, it
                  lost its association with the cruelty of the extractive
                  process and became associated with both secular refinement and
                  religious majesty.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn11" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup>

                  each new mission in the Philippines with an “ornament,”
                  chalice, paten, and bell from the royal treasury.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn13" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref13" class="footnote-ref-anchor">13</a></sup>
                  This basic service would later be augmented by both imported
                  goods from Mexico and Spain and objects forged locally. In the
                  early days of the colony, however, few churches were able to
                  adequately outfit their altars; reports from colonial
                  officials in Manila often lamented the lack of necessary and
                  beautifying <em>orfebrería</em> in the city’s cathedral.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn14" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup>
                  This was seen as a matter of some urgency; adequate silver was
                  necessary to maintain the dignity of mass, to minister to the
                  faithful, and to convert a new flock.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn15" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup>
                  Some priests took on the cause of ornamenting provincial
                  churches themselves rather than relying on their orders or the
                  Crown to do so, such as <em>fray</em> Fernando Cabrera, who
                  furnished the church of San Pablo de los Montes (Laguna) with
                  such a surfeit of liturgical silver that it was said to
                  outshine the cathedrals of Spain, and its most exceptional
                  object (a silver tabernacle described below) was subsequently
                  redistributed to the Augustinian convent in Manila a few miles
                  away.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn16" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup>
                  While the influx of silver coins via the Manila Galleon was
                  significant, the Crown placed limitations on the importation
                  of wrought silver to the colony.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn17" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup>
                  Private citizens and public officials could submit a formal
                  request to the Crown to import wrought silver and jewels for
                  their personal use.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn18" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref18" class="footnote-ref-anchor">18</a></sup>
                  Yet private citizens, government and church officials, and
                  institutions imported silver objects from Mexico with
                  regularity, often clandestinely.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn19" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref19" class="footnote-ref-anchor">19</a></sup>
                  At the time of his death in 1667, the archbishop of Manila,
                  Miguel de Poblete, had some forty-six items of
                  <em>plata labrada</em> (wrought silver) in his possession
                  valued at nearly 4,350 pesos, much of it likely brought from
                  his homeland of Mexico. Among them were sacred objects like
                  chalices and a silver-gilt bishop’s crosier but also luxury
                  goods including a set of coconut cups with silver mounts, a
                  perfumer, and three elaborate fountains.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn20" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  As in other colonies, arriving missionaries relied on local
                  artists and artisans to create religious objects for newly
                  constructed Catholic churches. The skill of sangley artisans
                  was more than sufficient to meet this need: So talented were
                  they in replicating European statuary that, by 1590, bishop
                  Domingo de Salazar wrote to Philip II that “soon we shall not
                  even miss those made in Flanders.” Salazar praised the quality
                  of smithing in particular: “Although the silversmiths do not
                  know how to enamel (for enamel is not used in China), in other
                  respects they produce marvelous work in gold and silver. They
                  are so skillful and clever that, as soon as there are any
                  objects made by a Spanish workman, they reproduce it with
                  exactness.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn21" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref21" class="footnote-ref-anchor">21</a></sup>
                  While Salazar was mistaken on the use of enamel in China,
                  which had begun in the fourteenth century, his high opinion of
                  sangley silversmiths’ talent was widely shared. Their work was
                  so desirable, in fact, that the <em>tumbaga</em> (an alloy of
                  copper, gold, and silver) choir screen in Mexico City’s
                  cathedral was commissioned from Chinese artisans in Macao in
                  the 1720s, and the Sultan of Jolo (Sulu) requested a sangley
                  silversmith be sent to his court in 1756.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn22" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref22" class="footnote-ref-anchor">22</a></sup>
                  As commerce with New Spain became more regular at the end of
                  the sixteenth century, imported religious objects were
                  presumably more available, but nevertheless there remained a
                  strong reliance on local manufacture in silver as well as
                  indigenous materials like nacre and wood.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The first wave of Chinese silversmiths came to Manila from the
                  provinces of Fujian and Guangdong, the latter of which became
                  a regional center of silver production in the sixteenth
                  century.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn23" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref23" class="footnote-ref-anchor">23</a></sup>
                  As with other artisans, they concentrated around the Parián,
                  the market just outside Manila’s walls where Asian goods were
                  bought and sold. Some arrived with skill in smithing, while
                  others likely learned their trade in Manila, which helped them
                  survive in a colony hostile to <em>chinos</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn24" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref24" class="footnote-ref-anchor">24</a></sup>
                  Later generations of silversmiths would be not only sangley
                  but also Chinese-mestizo and Filipino and likewise received
                  praise for their skill from Spanish commentators—in some cases
                  above sangleys.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn25" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref25" class="footnote-ref-anchor">25</a></sup>
                  By 1690, there were twenty-four sangley silversmiths working
                  in the Parián, and fifty-seven were active in the city in
                  1700.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn26" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref26" class="footnote-ref-anchor">26</a></sup>
                  Unlike their counterparts in Mexico, Manila’s artisans were
                  only nominally organized under a guild system and instead
                  operated through a series of independently run companies and
                  workshops, which numbered forty-eight by midcentury.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn27" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref27" class="footnote-ref-anchor">27</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  There is also evidence of at least one silversmith who also
                  worked as an ivory carver in the case of Juan de los Santos, a
                  Filipino born in the village of San Pablo de los Montes who
                  served as the sacristan of its church. De los Santos was
                  responsible for a variety of works in Augustinian churches in
                  the early seventeenth century, from gilded
                  <em>retablos</em> to ivory sculptures and elaborate objects
                  wrought in silver. While a perhaps singular example of talent,
                  de los Santos allows us some insight into the relationship
                  between commissioning friars and local artisans. According to
                  the Augustinian chronicler Pedro Andrés de Castro, “He made
                  with his own hands all of the silver ornaments of the church,
                  which were many and good . . . but everything was at the cost,
                  zeal, direction, and care of [the prior]
                  <em>fray</em> Fernando Cabrera,” the silver-loving priest from
                  above.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn28" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref28" class="footnote-ref-anchor">28</a></sup>
                  It is unlikely that any of these silver objects survives in
                  the San Agustin museum today, as much of the museum’s
                  collection was relocated from churches in Cebu, but Castro’s
                  text provides a sense of its splendor. He describes in great
                  detail a nine-and-a-half-foot high, gothic-style silver tower
                  made by de los Santos to hold a gold monstrance, which
                  featured five octagonal tiers with varying orders of columns
                  and was adorned with jewels, bas-reliefs, and figures of the
                  Apostles, Doctors of the Church, and angels. Clearly,
                  silversmiths in Manila were capable of a remarkable degree of
                  sophistication; as Castro noted in his text, in this instance,
                  the “work exceeded the material” (<em>materiam superabat opus</em>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn29" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref29" class="footnote-ref-anchor">29</a></sup>
                  As with many of Manila’s most spectacular silver objects, it
                  was seized during the British Occupation, reinforcing the
                  importance of documents like the Dominican inventory and
                  Castro’s chronicle to understand local silver production.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Such grandiose objects were commissioned because silver was a
                  key part of the missionizing effort, beautifying the church
                  space and enticing new converts to Catholicism through its
                  burnished splendor. The ornamentation of the church
                  “heightened the magnificence of the sacred” and moved the
                  pious to meditate on the divine.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn30" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref30" class="footnote-ref-anchor">30</a></sup>
                  The Jesuit chronicler Pedro Chirino reported that one vicar
                  “embellished [his church] with new ornaments, very rich and
                  curious, such as lamps and silver candlesticks, thereby
                  augmenting the reputation and esteem of our holy religion
                  among those new nations.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn31" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref31" class="footnote-ref-anchor">31</a></sup>
                  Laypeople likewise sought to enhance the beauty of the church
                  through pious bequests of silver, thereby participating in the
                  baroque theater of mass. As the Augustinian friar Juan de
                  Medina pointed out, silver made a more attractive bequest for
                  <em>manileños</em> because, unlike textiles, it would not
                  become destroyed by Luzon’s infamous humidity and could simply
                  be polished to renew its former luster.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn32" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref32" class="footnote-ref-anchor">32</a></sup>
                  And, much as the tarnish could be removed from sacred silver
                  objects through the labor of polishing, so too would the
                  redemptive nature of the sacraments wash away the stain of
                  sin.

                  Many objects in the Dominican inventory arrived as gifts,
                  often from Manila’s ecclesiastical and secular elite. These
                  were primarily jewels given in offering to statues, such as a
                  large silver star set with nine diamonds placed on the
                  forehead of a statue of Saint Dominic and given by the
                  bishop-elect of Nueva Segovia, Juan de Arrechedera, or several
                  jewels given to religious statues by Juana del Rosario, a
                  Japanese mestiza.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn33" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref33" class="footnote-ref-anchor">33</a></sup>
                  Other objects—like the small silver
                  <em>ramilletes</em> (stylized vases of flowers) donated by the
                  marquesa doña Rita de Quijano to Our Lady of the Rosary—were
                  intended to enhance the liturgical experience by ornamenting
                  the altar (fig. 2).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn34" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref34" class="footnote-ref-anchor">34</a></sup>
                  Unlike in Mexico or Peru, no statue paintings survive to show
                  us what these altars might have looked like, but written
                  sources can help to reconstruct their appearance. For example,
                  the devotees of <em>La Naval</em> adorned her altar with more
                  than fifty silver lamps and candlesticks to illuminate her
                  ivory countenance and sumptuous embroidered robes. The
                  governor of Ternate, Pedro de Heredia, was alone responsible
                  for donating two large candlesticks (<em>blandones</em>)
                  valued at over a thousand pesos each, twelve smaller
                  candlesticks (<em>candeleros</em>) at a hundred pesos apiece,
                  and a lamp valued at 1500 pesos.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn35" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref35" class="footnote-ref-anchor">35</a></sup>

                  It is unclear whether these objects were imported or locally
                  produced, though the latter seems most likely given the
                  availability of local talent and the time and expense of
                  importing finished silver objects from Mexico or Spain.
                  Philippine silver objects lack the hallmarks typically found
                  on their Mexican and Spanish counterparts because they were
                  often made from reworked silver pesos and therefore no royal
                  tax (<em>quinto real</em>) needed to be paid.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn36" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref36" class="footnote-ref-anchor">36</a></sup>
                  Other scholars attribute the lack of hallmarks to the abundant
                  use of filigree work, which left no room for stamping on its
                  delicate designs.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn37" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref37" class="footnote-ref-anchor">37</a></sup>
                  Hallmarks indicated not simply the payment of tax but also
                  revealed the maker, the location, the year, and the assayer
                  who gauged the quality of the work. This leaves the objects
                  that do survive today as orphans, unidentified in time, place,
                  or authorship. A silver panel from the Denver Art Museum
                  collection is a good illustration, not readily identifiable as
                  either Mexican or Philippine, though it was purchased in
                  Manila (fig. 3). In the nineteenth century, as the plantation
                  economy increased the wealth of provincial towns, prominent
                  citizens would commission silver altar frontals, which
                  sometimes had their names inscribed on them.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn38" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref38" class="footnote-ref-anchor">38</a></sup>
                  Inscriptions like these are, other than stylistic
                  attributions, analysis of wooden supports, and scant
                  documentary references, among the only ways to tie works
                  concretely to a geographic origin.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn39" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref39" class="footnote-ref-anchor">39</a></sup>

                  Unfortunately, but predictably, the Dominican inventory is
                  circumspect on the origins of the silver in its sacristies,
                  with only a few exceptions. In what was then the village of
                  Ermita, now a neighborhood in central Manila, one Padre
                  Bernabe commissioned for the church two heavy silver
                  chandeliers (<em>arañas</em>) weighing nine and a half pounds
                  as well as a silver cross for the altar.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn40" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref40" class="footnote-ref-anchor">40</a></sup>
                  Across the Pasig river, in the church of los Santos Reyes del
                  Parián, the silver chandeliers illuminating the altar of Santo
                  Cristo del Valle had been sent from Mexico.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn41" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref41" class="footnote-ref-anchor">41</a></sup>
                  In the seventeenth century, Manila’s once-impoverished
                  cathedral was at last furnished with “a quantity of wrought
                  silver and very rich ornaments and lamps” sent from
                  Guadalajara by archbishop Diego Camacho y Ávila.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn42" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref42" class="footnote-ref-anchor">42</a></sup>
                  Likewise, some of the surviving works at San Agustin are
                  thought to have been imported from Mexico, including a famous
                  bejeweled gold and enamel chalice from circa 1600—though more
                  recent attributions locate the work in Colombia or the
                  Philippines.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn43" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref43" class="footnote-ref-anchor">43</a></sup>
                  Unsurprisingly, many attributions are unreliable, like a set
                  of gold cruets at San Agustin whose serpentine handles are
                  said to represent Quetzalcoatl, a Mexica deity.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn44" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref44" class="footnote-ref-anchor">44</a></sup>
                  In one remarkable example, a Mexican chalice was reworked in
                  Manila and then donated to a parish in Andalucía (fig. 4). The
                  inscription on the base of the chalice states: “To the parish
                  of Mairena del Alcor, by Don Angel Carmona and companions
                  (<em>compañeros</em>), [made] in Acapulco, renewed by another
                  in Manila, 1787.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn45" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref45" class="footnote-ref-anchor">45</a></sup>
                  Stylistically, the work resembles Philippine typologies in the
                  undulating curve of its base, the three nodes (or knops) on
                  the stem, and the double cup separated by two rings, which
                  suggests that it was a substantial renovation, perhaps after
                  the original work sustained damage or simply to elaborate the
                  original design.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn46" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref46" class="footnote-ref-anchor">46</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Early works by sangley masters were often created using the
                  <em>ysot</em>, or wriggle-work technique, in which a v-shaped
                  chisel or burin incised designs into the silver plate. This
                  was joined in the late seventeenth century by chasing and by
                  repoussé, embossing, casting, and engraving in the
                  eighteenth.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn47" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref47" class="footnote-ref-anchor">47</a></sup>
                  Stylistically, these works can have an archaizing quality,
                  referencing earlier prototypes of Renaissance, Mannerist, and
                  early Baroque silver. Even Juan de los Santos’s nine-foot
                  silver confection harks back to the high Renaissance in its
                  composition of varying orders of columns.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn48" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref48" class="footnote-ref-anchor">48</a></sup>
                  Still, Philippine silver would eventually come to adopt rococo
                  designs like the s- and c- scrolls and <em>rocalla</em> that
                  were popularized in eighteenth-century Europe. As María Jesús
                  Sanz has pointed out, many of the surviving objects at San
                  Agustin betray simultaneous influences from Chinese, Spanish,
                  and Mexican silver traditions, which suggests a local
                  authorship.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn49" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref49" class="footnote-ref-anchor">49</a></sup>
                  So, too, does it bespeak the consistent importation of Mexican
                  and Spanish objects to serve as artistic prototypes, even if
                  these objects have been difficult to trace in the documentary
                  record.

                <p>
                  As mentioned, filigree was a technique favored by sangley
                  artisans, though it was also popular in the Americas,
                  Southeast Asia, and India. Filigree and granulation techniques
                  had been used in prehispanic Philippine goldwork, but filigree
                  became increasingly prominent after the arrival of Chinese
                  smiths in the sixteenth century.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn50" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref50" class="footnote-ref-anchor">50</a></sup>
                  San Agustin’s best surviving examples of the technique are in
                  gold: a <em>palabra</em> or <em>sacra</em>, probably the most
                  spectacular object in the collection, and a pen and heart
                  belonging to a statue of St. Augustine (fig. 5). These latter
                  objects may well be the same ornaments lauded by Castro in his
                  text, where he boasts that they “could shine in Rome and
                  Toledo for their value and workmanship.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn51" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref51" class="footnote-ref-anchor">51</a></sup>
                  Examples of filigree work were exported from the Philippines
                  to Spain, Italy, Mexico, and Lima, while others were traded
                  clandestinely to England via Madras (now Chennai).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn52" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref52" class="footnote-ref-anchor">52</a></sup>
                  They were found not only in private collections but in
                  ecclesiastical and royal settings: Splendid lamps commissioned
                  in the Philippines hung in the Dominican convent in Rome, and
                  filigree objects belonging to a lady’s dressing table (<em>tocador</em>
                  <em>de señora</em>) were displayed in the recently created
                  Real Gabinete de Historia Natural in Madrid alongside other
                  curiosities.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn53" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref53" class="footnote-ref-anchor">53</a></sup>
                  The exquisite quality of the work was often praised by
                  commentators, one of whom remarked that it had “astonished the
                  Europeans” (<em>pasmado a los Europeos</em>) who beheld it and
                  had quickly been imitated by Italian artisans—though Diego
                  Aduarte insisted they could not achieve the mastery of their
                  Asian counterparts.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn54" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref54" class="footnote-ref-anchor">54</a></sup>
                  A few examples of sangley filigree work have been identified
                  in Spain, including a monstrance in Caicedo de Yuso, which
                  came at the bequest of the <em>oidor</em> (judge) Francisco de
                  Samaniego, who had been born there and spent much of his

                <p>
                  Silver, including filigree work, was often incorporated into
                  works of ivory, not just as crowns and scepters but as the
                  wings on sets of ivory angels or as silver overlays on the
                  garments of religious statues.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn56" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref56" class="footnote-ref-anchor">56</a></sup>
                  But this technique was perhaps most famously used in the ivory
                  <em>niños dormidos</em> that rest on elaborate beds trimmed
                  with “trinkets and little pieces of silver.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn57" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref57" class="footnote-ref-anchor">57</a></sup>
                  The eighteenth-century niño dormido in the Bangko Sentral
                  collection is the prototypical example (fig. 6). It features
                  design elements that suggest Chinese or sangley authorship,
                  such as phoenixes and gourds wrought in silver and kingfisher
                  feather inlay. Its filigree work is also distinctly Chinese in
                  style, which tended to be smaller and more delicate than
                  contemporary Cuban or Central American examples.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn58" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref58" class="footnote-ref-anchor">58</a></sup>
                  While these objects have been primarily understood as domestic
                  in use, the Dominican convent had four such statues in its
                  inventory, which noted the Christ Child’s gilt-wood beds
                  dangling with silver, gold, and jewel-embellished
                  pendants.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn59" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref59" class="footnote-ref-anchor">59</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p><strong>Iglesia de los Santos Reyes del Parián</strong></p>
                <p>
                  To close with a brief example from this very lengthy
                  inventory, note the church of los Santos Reyes del Parián,
                  founded by the Dominican order in 1617 to minister to the
                  Chinese community, including the many artisans who sold their
                  wares there.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn60" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref60" class="footnote-ref-anchor">60</a></sup>
                  The original structure was rebuilt repeatedly before the area
                  was demolished in the late eighteenth century, the church
                  along with it. In his chronicle, Diego Aduarte describes the
                  “very well adorned” (<em>muy bien adornada</em>) church with
                  its many edifying images.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn61" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref61" class="footnote-ref-anchor">61</a></sup>
                  It was home to numerous painted and sculpted depictions of
                  saints and advocations of the Virgin—including
                  <em>Our Lady of Consolation</em> and
                  <em>Our Lady of Biglang Awa</em>—that were adorned with silver
                  bases, rostrillos, and crowns. In one of the lateral altars
                  stood the <em>Santo Christo del Valle</em> that had received
                  the donation of silver lanterns from Mexico.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The church was outfitted with all of the standard objects
                  appropriate to maintain the propriety and dignity of Mass,
                  including silver <em>gradillas</em> (small steps) to display
                  religious images, a tabernacle (<em>sagrario</em>), an altar
                  frontal, a pyx with its case, two monstrances, two chalices,
                  two sets of cruets, a reliquary of the True Cross, a baptismal
                  shell, and multiple palabras. But what is notable about this
                  church is that it is one of the only sections of the inventory
                  that includes reference to the weight or value of the silver
                  objects catalogued. One wonders if this is merely the work of
                  a singular, zealous priest with a scale or a result of the
                  artisan population ministered to in the Parian, with their
                  personal knowledge of the value of wrought silver.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn62" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref62" class="footnote-ref-anchor">62</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Many of the silver objects appear to have been made locally by
                  sangley artisans, some directly at the behest of the Chinese
                  Christian community, which remained a tiny minority in Manila.
                  Various objects, including a silver banner for a statue of St.
                  Dominic, were wrought from silver described as “unspendable”
                  (<em>ingastable</em>), which probably meant reserve silver,
                  meaning that the objects had been made in Manila and could be
                  melted down if necessary. Four large candleholders were made
                  jointly from this same unspendable silver as well as from
                  reworked pesos given as pious donations for masses by
                  parishioners. Other objects were commissioned specifically by
                  the sangley community, like a large silver lamp valued at over
                  240 pesos and funded jointly by the Dominican house, which
                  paid for the labor of the silversmith at a cost of twenty-five
                  pesos.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn63" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref63" class="footnote-ref-anchor">63</a></sup>
                  These objects tell us that the Chinese converts of Manila took
                  an active role in the beautification of their own church,
                  commissioning a lamp and entrusting a member of their
                  community to create this object as a devotional act. Notably,
                  none of the jewels recorded at the church were given by
                  sangley parishioners, which may suggest that they found
                  <em>platería</em> to be a worthier donation than the jewels
                  often favored by Manila’s peninsulars and creoles.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn64" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref64" class="footnote-ref-anchor">64</a></sup>
                  The inventory offers limited details—and may even be
                  incomplete, as one folio appears to be missing—but it gives us
                  a glimpse into the relationship that sangley converts had with
                  sacred silver.

                <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
                <p>
                  Across the archipelago, Philippine churches gleamed with
                  candlelight reflected in polished silver surfaces. Despite
                  clear evidence of their abundance, the origins—and fates—of
                  these objects remain largely obscure. Without extended
                  archival and collections research, it remains difficult to
                  fully trace the history of importation and production of
                  silver in the Philippines. In 1990, Ramon N. Villegas posed
                  future directions for the study of Philippine silver;
                  thirty-five years later, these questions remain largely
                  unanswered.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn65" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref65" class="footnote-ref-anchor">65</a></sup>
                  For example, too little is known about the role of inter-Asian
                  trade in silverworks; this essay is also guilty of trying to
                  triangulate Philippine silver between the nodes of China,
                  Mexico, and Spain without reference to additional influences
                  from Southeast Asia.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What is clear is that sangley and, to a lesser extent,
                  Indigenous artisans dominated the trade for wrought silver,
                  producing works that were so prized as to be traded across the
                  globe and displayed in exalted spaces from Lima to Rome.
                  Manila’s sangley artisans have been examined primarily as
                  ivory carvers. Attending to their roles as silversmiths helps
                  us better understand not only the kinds of work they produced
                  but the very nature of artistic production in a city where
                  professions were plastic and immigrants looked for economic
                  opportunities wherever they might appear.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-08santner-essay-fn66" id="page-08santner-essay-fnref66" class="footnote-ref-anchor">66</a></sup>

                  Singapore’s Asian Civilisations Museum collection features an
                  unusual small wooden writing cabinet that can be closely
                  associated with some ten other cabinets and chests.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-10onn-essay-fn1" id="page-10onn-essay-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                  The group exhibits an intriguing combination of influences:
                  The form of the fall-front writing cabinet became popular in
                  Europe during the late Renaissance, while the stylistic
                  features of the carving and inlay point to a Chinese source.
                  Moreover, these cabinets are fashioned out of tropical
                  hardwoods found in Southeast Asia. This rich combination
                  suggests that the cabinets were made in a colonial port city
                  in Southeast Asia, almost certainly Manila in the Philippines
                  in the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Singapore cabinet in particular adds yet another cultural
                  connection: the Americas, for the inlay decoration on the
                  interior surface of the fall front depicts the founding myth
                  of Tenochtitlan, the capital of the Mexica people (fig. 1). A
                  crowned eagle perches on a nopal cactus, which grows out of
                  the Nahuatl glyph for water (<em>atl</em>). The eagle holds a
                  snake in its beak. This famous symbol of the Mexica became the
                  emblem of what would become Mexico City. Therefore, the
                  cabinet was probably commissioned by or for a dignitary in New
                  Spain.

                  Details of the decoration suggest that the patron had a
                  sophisticated knowledge of not just Mexico City but
                  Tenochtitlan. At the left of the composition, a nobleman with
                  a beaded necklace points to the bird (fig. 2). His attire
                  resembles that seen in an illustration of Acamapichtli, the
                  first <em>tlatoani</em> (ruler) of the Mexica and founder of
                  the imperial dynasty (fig. 3). On the right, a noblewoman

                  While the basic form of these portable writing cabinets is
                  European, imaginative design variations connect them with
                  Chinese furniture-making in the Philippines. Several features
                  can be found in Chinese furniture, including the beast mask,
                  claw-and-ball feet at the corners, scalloped apron at the
                  lower front, and drawer pulls with lion heads.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-10onn-essay-fn2" id="page-10onn-essay-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                  The inlaid decoration touches on several cultures: In addition
                  to the figures and symbols from Mexica history, the floral
                  bouquets in the four corners are commonly encountered in
                  European art. Although only the Singapore cabinet has a
                  specifically Mexican motif, it seems that other examples from
                  this grouping may also have been made for export to New Spain.

                </p>
                <p>
                  Beginning in the late fifteenth century, advances in
                  navigation and ship technology opened new routes between
                  Europe and Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Large vessels
                  carrying substantial cargoes could now sail thousands of
                  miles, which allowed for the rapid expansion of trade,
                  military conquest, and the spread of Christianity, often with
                  tragic results for the Indigenous peoples of the world. As
                  this new trading system established outposts in distant lands,
                  people from various cultures gathered and mingled. Indeed,
                  global trade depended on networks of port cities that became
                  vibrant hubs for the exchange of people, goods, technology,
                  and art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-10onn-essay-fn3" id="page-10onn-essay-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The transpacific galleons that carried goods and people
                  between the Philippines and Mexico were controlled by the
                  Spanish Crown, which regulated ship construction, the nature
                  of the shipments, and their sale in Mexico. The cargoes were
                  sold in Acapulco and transported overland to Mexico City. Some
                  goods continued on to Veracruz, the port in the Caribbean,
                  where they were shipped to Spain or Spanish-controlled cities
                  in the Americas. The Manila–Acapulco Galleon trade lasted from
                  1565 to 1815, with its heyday in the seventeenth and
                  eighteenth centuries. The ships, which could sail only once a
                  year in each direction, were Spain’s only link to Asia, since
                  the route around Africa was mostly controlled by the
                  Portuguese and later by the Dutch and British. The Spanish
                  depended on the safe crossings of the galleons not only for
                  profit but for their political survival in the Philippines.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The galleons made Manila one of the world’s most vibrant
                  ports, drawing traders from China, Spain, Mexico, India, and
                  indeed the entire world. In 1662, the Franciscan monk
                  Bartolomé de Letona wrote that “the variety of nations seen in
                  Manila and its surroundings is the greatest in the world; one
                  finds peoples from all the kingdoms and nations, for example,
                  Spain, France, England . . . from the West and East Indies,
                  Turks, Greeks, Persians, Tartars, Chinese, Japanese, Africans,
                  and Asians.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-10onn-essay-fn4" id="page-10onn-essay-fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                  Nearly a century later, the Jesuit friar Pedro Murillo Velarde
                  (1696–1753) remained impressed by Manila’s diversity: “Not one
                  colony, of all those founded by Europeans in Asia and Africa,
                  equals it in greatness, wealth, abundance, and community. . .
                  . The meeting of various nations—I do not think there is
                  anything like it in the world.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-10onn-essay-fn5" id="page-10onn-essay-fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  While trade linked Asia and Mexico, it was the interaction of
                  individuals at all levels of society that generated an
                  eclectic material culture. Although the vast majority of
                  surviving Mexican and Philippine colonial art is religious in
                  nature, secular art was also produced for every aspect of
                  colonial society. Elite households in Spain, Portugal, and
                  Mexico often mingled Spanish, Flemish, Italian, German, and
                  Asian furnishings.
                  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-10onn-essay-fn6" id="page-10onn-essay-fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>
                  Contemporary portraits of wealthy individuals display an array
                  of global objects that flaunt their wealth, influence, and
                  sophistication. In Asia, inventories of the multicultural
                  residents of Malacca and Batavia (present-day Jakarta) reveal
                  that individuals accumulated belongings from Europe, China,
                  Japan, Myanmar, Sulawesi, Java, Sri Lanka, and India, among
                  other places.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-10onn-essay-fn7" id="page-10onn-essay-fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>
                  The inhabitants of Manila were no different, and by the late
                  sixteenth century, goods converged there from all over the
                  world.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-10onn-essay-fn8" id="page-10onn-essay-fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>

                  The Manila galleons primarily carried Chinese goods to Mexico
                  and beyond. For example, the inventories of ships from 1565 to
                  1576 (<em>Caja de Filipinas</em> or <em>Contaduría</em>)
                  regularly list porcelain and silk.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-10onn-essay-fn9" id="page-10onn-essay-fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>
                  From the mid-seventeenth century, records of porcelain
                  entering and leaving Cavite, the main port of call in the
                  Philippines, diminish significantly, perhaps because export
                  porcelain was reclassified as private trade and would not have
                  appeared in official records.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-10onn-essay-fn10" id="page-10onn-essay-fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup>
                  Moreover, contraband and the falsification of ship registries
                  were common throughout the history of the galleons.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-10onn-essay-fn11" id="page-10onn-essay-fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup>
                  Furniture is nearly absent from galleon records: Isolated
                  examples may have escaped the attention of officials and in
                  any case were not described in detail.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-10onn-essay-fn12" id="page-10onn-essay-fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup>
                  Most cabinets and chests were likely regarded as functional
                  objects meant to transport other commodities, or perhaps they
                  were classified as personal effects to avoid tax.
                </p>
                <p>
                  References to furniture can be found in colonial estate
                  inventories and wills, which sometimes suggest Asian origin.
                  Early Spanish accounts of the Philippines report that there
                  was very little furniture in Filipino residences.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-10onn-essay-fn13" id="page-10onn-essay-fnref13" class="footnote-ref-anchor">13</a></sup>
                  Only after a period of Spanish rule did Indigenous life
                  incorporate more European-style furniture in interiors. In
                  fact, most terms used in the Philippines for furniture are
                  derived from Spanish: A chair is a <em>silya</em>, from the
                  Spanish <em>silla</em>; a table is a <em>mesa</em>, and so
                  forth. However, the lack of documentation for most surviving
                  examples of furniture in the Philippines makes it impossible
                  to identify individual furniture makers during the seventeenth
                  and eighteenth centuries, whether Chinese immigrant
                  (<em>sangley</em>) or local Filipino artists or collaborations
                  between them.

                  Chinese styles and techniques were gradually integrated with
                  local motifs to create hybrid forms, with many motifs being
                  shared across Asia and Europe along the trade networks. One
                  distinctive cross-cultural creation of the Philippines is the
                  altar table (fig. 4). This type of table was commonly used in
                  churches and homes for the display of offerings and religious
                  figures. Early examples like the one in figure 4 resemble
                  Chinese tables, with curving legs that end with paws grasping
                  balls. Beast masks with long tongues perch atop each leg. Wide
                  stretchers connect the legs to provide stability, while the
                  short feet protect the furniture from moisture. Aspects of
                  this design can be found in furniture made in China, Europe,
                  and Southeast Asia. The <em>balayong</em> tree (cassia) from
                  which the wood comes is native to the Philippines. In the
                  seventeenth century, three regions were known to produce
                  Philippine furniture: Bohol, Baliuag, and Batangas. The latter
                  two regions are noted for such altar tables. Gradually, the
                  demand for these pieces spread to other regions, including
                  Bicol, Mindoro, and Cebu.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-10onn-essay-fn14" id="page-10onn-essay-fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup>
                </p>

                  Early patrons of Philippine furniture were the clergy and
                  Spanish officials who commissioned Chinese artisans to furnish
                  churches, monasteries, and colonial offices. By the late
                  seventeenth century, Chinese merchants and artists had started
                  marrying into the local community. Despite racial prejudice
                  and legal barriers, individuals of Chinese and Filipino
                  descent came to dominate the production of consumer goods. New
                  groups of affluent patrons moved beyond Chinese-inspired
                  models for domestic secular furniture.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-10onn-essay-fn15" id="page-10onn-essay-fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup>
                  Their requirements were naturally quite different from those
                  of churches. By the late eighteenth century, Philippine
                  furniture displayed Chinese and Spanish colonial features,
                  together with local and other European details, all
                  confidently integrated to create a uniquely Philippine
                  aesthetic.

                  Records indicate that many woodworking shops were found along
                  waterways. Furniture makers would have resided in the major
                  trading towns, acquiring the lumber and distributing their
                  finished products by water. Workshops in the province of
                  Batangas were centered in the towns around Taal Lake: Calaca,
                  Lemery-Taal, San Pascual-Bauan, and Lipa. Manila and central
                  Luzon workshops could be found along the riverine settlements
                  from Tondo-Malabon, Meycauayan-Marilao, Baliuag, Malolos,
                  Calumpit, Apalit, Guagua, and the Pampanga river system all
                  the way up to Nueva Ecija.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-10onn-essay-fn16" id="page-10onn-essay-fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup>
                  These workshops flourished over several generations through a
                  system of apprenticeship, while the more popular designs would
                  have persisted over time, often taken up by other furniture
                  workshops.

                <p>
                  The collection of the San Agustin Church in Manila, much of
                  which can be documented to the seventeenth century,
                  exemplifies Philippine furniture. For instance, claw-and-ball
                  feet emerging from beast masks and scalloped carving on the
                  apron can be found in numerous pieces. Sometimes thought to
                  have been made in Guangzhou and then exported to the
                  Philippines, many of these pieces are made of tropical
                  hardwoods, which points to an origin in the Philippines.
                  Contemporary observers noted that there was a thriving
                  community of Chinese furniture makers in Manila, who almost
                  certainly collaborated with Indigenous artists.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-10onn-essay-fn17" id="page-10onn-essay-fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup>

                  The church of San Agustin possesses numerous pieces of
                  furniture adorned with Chinese motifs. The most spectacular of
                  these are the sixty-eight intricately carved choirstalls
                  commissioned by Miguel García Serrano between 1608 and 1614
                  (fig. 5). The strapwork motifs relate to late Renaissance
                  design while the woods are kamagong with inlays of narra, both
                  native to the Philippines.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-10onn-essay-fn18" id="page-10onn-essay-fnref18" class="footnote-ref-anchor">18</a></sup>
                  Interspersed among the decorations are the chrysanthemums
                  common in Chinese and Japanese art, and cabriole legs emerge
                  from beast masks and end in claw-and-ball feet.

                  The large lectern in the choir loft of the church of San
                  Agustin is said to have been commissioned by Félix Trillo
                  around 1728–34 (fig. 6). The lower part of the choir lectern
                  is a curious mix of motifs, amalgamating Christian figures
                  such as cherubs, angel heads, and Augustinian hearts pierced
                  by two arrows with Western female figures, Chinese mythical
                  guardian dogs, and scrolling clouds. Another choir lectern, in
                  Mexico City Cathedral, was carved out of <em>tindalo</em>, a
                  Philippine hardwood, and presented in 1762 by the archbishop
                  of Manila, Manuel Rojo del Río y Vieyra.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-10onn-essay-fn19" id="page-10onn-essay-fnref19" class="footnote-ref-anchor">19</a></sup>
                  It is likely that these examples were produced by Chinese
                  furniture makers in Manila. Within the sacristy of San
                  Agustin, long cabinets (<em>cajonerías</em>) line both sides
                  of the hall (fig. 7). These cabinets store liturgical
                  vestments of the priests. The cabinets rest on beast masks
                  with paw feet; the drawers are carved in rich floral reliefs.
                  The massive furniture in this room was commissioned by
                  Dionisio Suárez between 1653 and 1674.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-10onn-essay-fn20" id="page-10onn-essay-fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup>
                  A pair of fall-front cabinets, richly carved in dark hardwood
                  with relief scenes, also bear beast masks and claw-and-ball
                  feet (fig. 8). These examples help to relate the Singapore
                  cabinet to its larger group.

                  Writing cabinets enjoyed considerable popularity from the
                  sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries. Essentially a small
                  chest of drawers, they had hinged front panels that could be
                  lowered for use as a writing surface. When the fall front is
                  closed, the cabinet could usually be locked for transport or
                  to secure valuables. These intimate pieces of furniture invite
                  close inspection and are often elaborately decorated. As
                  demonstrated, furniture makers in the Americas and Asia
                  contributed new motifs and materials to the genre, especially
                  through the use of rare hardwoods and exotic materials such as
                  ivory, tortoiseshell, and mother-of-pearl. Lacquered cabinets
                  made in China and Japan were exported to the Americas and
                  Europe, and decorative schemes were borrowed from the symbolic
                  systems of China, Renaissance Europe, and Mexico to delight
                  connoisseurs. Specialized forms of art developed along the
                  trade routes, from China—which for centuries had tailored its
                  products specifically to consumers in other cultures—to the
                  Philippines, Mexico, and the rest of the Americas. Many of
                  these works had multiple connections to European and
                  Indigenous artistic traditions, which changed over time.

                  A distinguishing feature of these Philippine cabinets is that
                  the inlays are usually bone rather than ivory. Contemporary
                  pieces made in the Indian regions of Gujarat and Sindh for the
                  Portuguese market and in Agra for the Mughal court commonly
                  employed ivory for inlay decoration (fig. 9). Ivory was not
                  especially rare in the Philippines as it was extensively used
                  for religious sculpture, but it may have been regarded as more
                  appropriate for sacred images, which in turn discouraged its
                  use on secular furniture. There may also have been a more
                  pragmatic reason: Bone was cheaper and more widely available.
                  In Spain’s Nasrid period (1232–1492), artists in Granada often
                  mixed ivory and bone in their inlaid furniture, and this
                  practice may have also been used in making Spanish colonial
                  possessions.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-10onn-essay-fn21" id="page-10onn-essay-fnref21" class="footnote-ref-anchor">21</a></sup>
                  Both ivory and bone were typically shaped, carved, engraved,
                  or pyrographed before being inserted into a wood support. In
                  Baliuag of Bulacan, one of the well-regarded furniture-making
                  towns of the Philippines, were many water buffalo
                  slaughterhouses. The abundant supply of bone might have
                  produced a secondary craft industry of bone inlay to decorate
                  furniture.

                  Though the work in the Asian Civilisations Museum collection
                  is European in form, the object resembles the fine inlaid
                  furniture produced in India for the Portuguese (fig. 10) or
                  even cabinets made in the Americas. However, this example was

                  As mentioned, the inlay decoration shows the foundation myth
                  of Tenochtitlan. It is unusual to find such Mexica imagery on
                  a European-style, fall-front cabinet made in the Philippines.
                  The motif of the crowned eagle perched on a flowering cactus
                  is a common one. However, the two flanking figures are more
                  unusual and suggest a specific source in a Mexican codex. The
                  woman on the right stands on a platform, while the man
                  opposite stands on rocky terrain. This alludes to the higher
                  status of the noblewoman. The beaded necklace held by the
                  noblewoman can also be seen in the Durán Codex (1579), where
                  Hernán Cortés meets a local leader on the way to Tlaxcala
                  (fig. 11). A similar beaded necklace was presented, probably
                  as a gift to Cortés by the local chief. In the context of the

                  The small central drawer is inlaid with an arch supported by
                  serpentine columns, a familiar European motif, although the
                  forms have been somewhat abbreviated. The four supports are
                  carved with beast masks over claw-and-ball feet, a southern
                  Chinese motif, as already discussed. This suggests that this
                  cabinet was produced by Chinese artists working in the
                  Philippines. Many of these cabinets and chests are decorated
                  with an abstract motif at the corners consisting of two birds
                  joined together—reminiscent of the double-headed Habsburg
                  eagle but with a whimsical flavor since they resemble an
                  abstract flower. The double-headed eagle was a symbol of the
                  Habsburg dynasty, which ruled the Spanish empire between 1516
                  and 1700. It became extremely common in decorative elements
                  around the world.

                  The front of the writing cabinet is decorated with a diamond
                  intersected by angled lines that form a swastika-like pattern.
                  This motif, which recalls Chinese patterns, can also be found
                  on other writing cabinets of the group (fig. 12 and those in
                  the collections of the Museo Soumaya and the family of Mr. and
                  Mrs. Lee Kip Lee) but is otherwise absent from furniture of
                  this period, suggesting that these pieces were produced in a
                  single workshop.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-10onn-essay-fn22" id="page-10onn-essay-fnref22" class="footnote-ref-anchor">22</a></sup>

                  These closely related cabinets were probably special
                  commissions from important individuals. For example, a chest
                  in the Museo Franz Mayer is decorated with an unidentified
                  coat of arms, surmounted by a three-pointed coronet that
                  identifies the patron as a viscount (fig. 13).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-10onn-essay-fn23" id="page-10onn-essay-fnref23" class="footnote-ref-anchor">23</a></sup>
                  The escutcheon is flanked by two vases filled with flowers and
                  pairs of birds resting on the stalks. At the corners are the
                  floral elements from the Singapore cabinet, though here they
                  are even more explicitly birdlike. Another cabinet in the
                  Museo Franz Mayer displays several cross-cultural elements
                  (fig. 14). The sides show chariots drawn by winged dragons, a
                  European Renaissance motif, perhaps transmitted via a print or
                  drawing. The scrolling vine and flower border resembles a
                  design popular on Chinese blue-and-white porcelain and Indian
                  chintz, which also appears in Mexican
                  <em>talavera</em> blue-and-white ceramics. On the lid is an
                  unidentified coat of arms, while the corners are decorated
                  with double-headed birds surmounted with a crown and
                  surrounded by stylized acanthus leaves.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-10onn-essay-fn24" id="page-10onn-essay-fnref24" class="footnote-ref-anchor">24</a></sup>
                  This version is closer to the double-headed Habsburg eagle
                  than the abstracted motif found on the other cabinets. In the
                  Singapore cabinet, the motif no longer even resembles two
                  birds but appears more like a fleur-de-lis bouquet, a motif
                  also found on Philippine altar tables (fig. 15).

                <p><strong>Extravagant Variations</strong></p>
                <p>
                  Two impressive cabinets show close affinities with the
                  examples discussed here but are decorated in a more opulent
                  manner (figs. 16 and 17). Complex patterns of vines, figures,
                  and fantastical animals were created by setting engraved
                  pieces of bone into wooden panels. Both pieces share a
                  characteristic type of segmented vine formed from interlocking
                  C-shaped sections rather than the continuously flowing
                  tendrils often found in European and Chinese designs. This
                  type of decoration is quite different from the presumably
                  earlier inlaid furniture made by Chinese makers in the
                  Philippines, which is sparer in decoration and often has the
                  double-bird motif (see figs. 1, 12–14). Most of these examples
                  have claw-and-ball feet that emerge from beast masks and the
                  scalloped apron. They have certain similarities with furniture
                  made in India for the Portuguese market, for example, in the
                  fine inlays and combination of European and Asian motifs.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-10onn-essay-fn25" id="page-10onn-essay-fnref25" class="footnote-ref-anchor">25</a></sup>

                <p>
                  In a cabinet with ten drawers, the center drawer with a lock
                  is decorated as though it were a coat of arms, with a crown
                  above the metal lock plate, flanked by two lions holding fly
                  whisks (fig. 16).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-10onn-essay-fn26" id="page-10onn-essay-fnref26" class="footnote-ref-anchor">26</a></sup>
                  Beneath the lock plate, male figures holding palm fronds and
                  baskets flank a lotus flower. The combination of Chinese
                  motifs, such as the lotus and lions, with European Renaissance
                  nudes indicates that this cabinet was produced in a
                  cross-cultural environment like Manila. Additional evidence
                  indicates that the maker was Chinese: Most of the drawers are
                  marked with Chinese characters indicating their positions:
                  東， 中， 西 (right, middle, and left), with additional
                  indications of above and below, 上，下.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The top of this cabinet is decorated with vines from which two
                  half-figures emerge. The lower apron of the cabinet may have
                  been reconfigured to support a cover that is now missing. The
                  original probably had neither a fall front nor a cover.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another writing cabinet with a hinged front is densely inlaid
                  with segmented vines (fig. 17). In the central oval medallion,
                  a large bird spreads its wings, with two smaller birds to
                  either side. This motif closely resembles the Christian symbol
                  of a pelican piercing its breast to feed its young,
                  representing the sacrifice of Christ. A new base was added to
                  the cabinet, apparently using the original feet.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Given their shared materials and decorative schemes, could
                  these inlaid cabinets, chests, and boxes have been produced by
                  a single Chinese workshop in the Philippines? The variety of
                  sizes, quality of inlay decoration, and the variations in
                  decoration indicate that they did not constitute a single
                  order for a client but multiple orders over a considerable
                  period. It is very likely that some of them were commissioned
                  for Mexico. Until documentary evidence is uncovered, the full
                  histories of these objects remain a fascinating mystery.

                        The mask decoration has been called that of a lion,
                        beast, ogre, or demon. Early collectors and dealers in
                        the Philippines referred to this type of decoration as
                        <em>demonyo</em> (Tagalog for demon) or
                        <em>dinemonyo</em>. For this paper, the design is called
                        the beast mask.

                  In 1588, Luís Fróis (1532–1597), a Portuguese Jesuit and
                  missionary to Japan, offered striking praise for various
                  lacquered boxes gifted by the warlord Toyotomi Hideyoshi to
                  the viceroy of Portuguese India. On their craftsmanship, he
                  declared:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    Undoubtedly, if anyone across Europe sees it, they will
                    marvel at the delicacy and perfection of such a work. For it
                    is entirely covered, inside and out, with a kind of varnish,
                    which in Japan is called <em>urushi</em>, sprinkled with
                    ground gold in the manner of sand . . . and wrought with
                    flowers and roses made from thin sheets of silver and gold,
                    which are fitted in such a way with said urushi, that in no
                    case can one see any sign of joinery, nor can one
                    understand, if one does not know how such a work is made, by
                    which it becomes very graceful, rich, and pleasing to the
                    eye. [<em>por nenhum cazo se pode ver conjuntura, nem se pode

                <p>
                  Fróis marveled at the lustrous surface of gold and silver
                  suspended in layers of “varnish,” East Asian lacquer known in
                  Japanese as <em>urushi</em>, a natural polymer derived from
                  the sap of the <em>Toxicodendron vernicifluum</em> tree.
                  Refined at low temperatures, it can be mixed with pigment to
                  obtain a deep color, most commonly red or black. Once cured in
                  a humidity-controlled environment, it forms a hard, heat- and
                  water-resistant surface. Manipulating urushi is both delicate
                  and dangerous: The raw sap is toxic and can cause severe skin
                  reactions. Artisans prepare a wooden base with a ground
                  foundation before applying several layers of urushi and
                  finishing with meticulous polishing to achieve a smooth,
                  lustrous surface that hides any hint of handiwork. Along with
                  its durability, lacquerware’s adhesive properties made it an
                  ideal surface for decoration in East Asian artistic
                  traditions. In Japan, artisans excelled in the decorative
                  technique known as <em>makie</em> (sprinkled picture), where
                  silver and gold powder are dusted “in the manner of sand,” in
                  Fróis’s words, onto wet urushi to create intricate designs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Fróis’s reverence for lacquer’s seamless brilliance speaks to
                  its success as an art form within the Iberian world.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-06luterbacher-final-fn2" id="page-06luterbacher-final-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                  As the Portuguese and Spanish established a presence in Asia,
                  lacquer workshops across the Pacific rim adapted their
                  techniques to produce chests, writing desks, and religious
                  objects made specifically for export to a Catholic consumer
                  base in the Iberian world. Indeed, Fróis emphasized lacquer’s
                  dual function as both a coating and a carrier of sacred
                  Catholic materials, concluding his account by noting that such
                  lacquered boxes “could serve well as chests for relics.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-06luterbacher-final-fn3" id="page-06luterbacher-final-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                  Brought to the Spanish Americas by the Manila Galleon trade,
                  surviving export lacquerware bears traces of colonial artistic
                  intervention. Especially prized in New Spain, portable
                  lacquered shrines with hinged doors and removable frames for
                  sacred images were combined with local artistic practices such
                  as painting and feather work.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-06luterbacher-final-fn4" id="page-06luterbacher-final-fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Fróis’s admiration aligns with a broader Iberian missionary
                  discourse that prized such surface effects in the arts newly
                  encountered along Portuguese and Spanish trade routes. But
                  while art historians have tended to emphasize the reflective
                  qualities of these circulating objects, such as their
                  iridescence, Fróis’s praise for lacquerwork’s surface directs
                  attention not only to the visual but also to the tactile,
                  thereby signaling a further mark of its making: its seamless
                  facture.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-06luterbacher-final-fn5" id="page-06luterbacher-final-fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>
                  In the craftsperson’s expert hands, “in no case can one see
                  any sign of joinery.” Seamless facture was highly prized in
                  preindustrial societies, giving rise to labor-intensive
                  artisanal processes that concealed traces of human handiwork
                  beneath an illusion of effortless creation, evoking objects
                  fashioned by nature, or even by miracle.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-06luterbacher-final-fn6" id="page-06luterbacher-final-fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>
                  By blurring the boundaries between nature and artifice, such
                  skill could conjure the <em>acheiropoieton</em>: the Christian
                  image ostensibly “not made by human hands” but rather through
                  contact with the divine. Such conceptions of wondrous and
                  miraculous making resonated with Renaissance ideals of
                  authored identity, in which the artist demonstrated the
                  capacity to unify diverse elements into a seamless synthesis
                  of material and form.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-06luterbacher-final-fn7" id="page-06luterbacher-final-fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>
                  Fróis’s description reveals how Iberian observers recognized
                  the ingenuity and skill of makers outside Europe, an
                  acknowledgment that some scholars argue helped shape an early
                  modern humanistic conception of the arts as a universal
                  phenomenon.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-06luterbacher-final-fn8" id="page-06luterbacher-final-fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>
                  I contend, rather, that this discourse on facture discloses a
                  deeper aesthetic tension: The object’s surface appearance
                  produces an impression of seamless facture, one that
                  simultaneously showcases artistic virtuosity and obscures the
                  disparate forms of labor that underlie its creation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Beyond merely imposing European discourse onto foreign
                  artworks, this rhetoric of facture was formed from the very
                  materials and craft cultures that intermingled within the
                  sixteenth- and seventeenth-century transpacific system. Once
                  viewed as peripheral, the Manila Galleon route has emerged in
                  scholarship as a central axis of early modern global
                  trade.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-06luterbacher-final-fn9" id="page-06luterbacher-final-fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>
                  It linked far-flung sites of manufacture, enabling the
                  sequential fabrication of art objects as they moved through
                  local workshops within the vast Iberian maritime networks of
                  the Indo-Pacific. Religion and commerce remained inseparable
                  within this system: Mercantile and missionary imperatives did
                  not merely coexist but actively conditioned the creation and
                  movement of objects along these routes. The prizing of
                  seemingly wondrous and miraculous facture extended to
                  circulating artworks, obscuring their underlying imperial
                  systems of production.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-06luterbacher-final-fn10" id="page-06luterbacher-final-fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup>
                  Through this lens, I argue that the rhetoric of “seamlessness”
                  engaged with the diverse artistic interventions that an object
                  might at once consolidate and conceal. Particularly revealing
                  in this regard are the lacquer shrines made for export, which
                  brought together Christian icons within ornamental housings,
                  attempting to seamlessly integrate radically different forms,
                  materials, and decorative techniques in a single devotional
                  object.

                <p>
                  Export lacquerware for the Iberian market emerged from the
                  Christian mission in Japan and its ties to maritime trade. It
                  is now known as Nanban lacquerware, a period term meaning
                  “southern barbarians,” applied to Iberian visitors after
                  Portuguese merchants arrived in southern Japan around 1543.
                  Jesuit missionary Francis Xavier established the Catholic
                  mission in Japan in 1549, and by 1580, the Portuguese had made
                  Nagasaki their official port. That same year, the union of the
                  Spanish and Portuguese Crowns informally connected their
                  maritime empires, placing Japan at the crossroads of both the
                  Portuguese State of India (encompassing Goa and Macau) and the
                  Spanish Manila–Acapulco galleon trade. By the late sixteenth
                  century, Franciscan, Augustinian, and Dominican missionaries
                  from Manila had further integrated export lacquerware into the
                  transpacific trade system. This exchange declined when Japan
                  banned Christianity in 1614, and Nanban lacquerware production
                  ceased entirely in 1639 with the termination of commercial and
                  religious ties.

                <p>
                  What began within the Jesuit mission expanded into wider
                  Iberian commerce as lacquerware became a common commodity on
                  Portuguese and, later, Spanish ships. Despite their vow of
                  poverty, the Society of Jesus in Japan was heavily involved in
                  the silk trade as a means of gaining favor with local feudal
                  lords (<em>daimyō</em>), drawing criticism within the order as
                  well as from competing missionary groups like the
                  Franciscans.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-06luterbacher-final-fn11" id="page-06luterbacher-final-fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup>
                  Jesuit sources seldom name lacquer artisans, but those
                  mentioned are often identified as Christian converts.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-06luterbacher-final-fn12" id="page-06luterbacher-final-fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup>
                  Through conversion, missionaries secured access to lacquerware
                  production while assuring external authorities that genuine
                  Christians crafted their religious items. In
                  Portuguese-controlled Asian territories like
                  Goa,&nbsp;European-style guild regulations were imposed on local
                  craft communities, mirroring practices in the Latin American
                  colonies.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-06luterbacher-final-fn13" id="page-06luterbacher-final-fnref13" class="footnote-ref-anchor">13</a></sup>
                  In parts of Asia that lay outside direct colonial control—such
                  as Japan—Iberian authorities typically relied on local
                  artisans or formed economic partnerships, leading to more
                  flexible enforcement.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nanban lacquerware developed alongside Jesuit accommodation
                  strategies during this period of exchange. The early mission
                  benefited from Japan’s state of civil war, as Iberian
                  merchants and missionaries sought alliances with rival feudal
                  lords. Missionaries adapted to local customs, adopting
                  Japanese dress and architecture to spread their Christian
                  message among regional elites. Recognizing lacquerware’s elite
                  status and sacred role, they promoted it as an evangelical and
                  diplomatic tool. By the late sixteenth century, lacquer
                  workshops already operated on a large scale under a master
                  craftsman who managed orders, designs, and apprentices. These
                  workshops favored&nbsp;<em>hiramakie</em>&nbsp;(flat makie), a more
                  expedient technique using metal powder to produce low-relief
                  motifs. This method appealed to Japanese warrior and merchant
                  tastes and allowed quicker production to satisfy growing
                  demand.

                  These local forms and techniques were adapted to missionary
                  Catholic ends in Nanban lacquer shrines, which developed a
                  distinct decorative aesthetic. Lacquer artisans reconfigured
                  traditional <em>zushi</em> (portable shrines) to create
                  versions designed for export to house Christian devotional
                  images.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-06luterbacher-final-fn14" id="page-06luterbacher-final-fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup>
                  An example now held at the Santa Maria da Caridade in the
                  Portuguese town of Sardoal features hinged doors beneath a
                  roofed gable; enshrined inside is an oil-on-copper painting of
                  the Virgin and Child (fig. 1).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-06luterbacher-final-fn15" id="page-06luterbacher-final-fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup>
                  The sacrality of the icon is both affirmed and delineated
                  through the use of Japanese techniques and seasonal motifs in
                  an ornamental capacity: The gable and the inner faces of the
                  doors, which surround the image, are densely decorated with
                  camellias and mandarin oranges and maple trees, enclosed
                  within geometric borders. Such seasonal floral motifs were
                  common on Japanese religious shrines, where they carried
                  auspicious associations.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-06luterbacher-final-fn16" id="page-06luterbacher-final-fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup>
                  The Sardoal shrine’s abundant vegetal ornamentation in gold
                  and mother-of-pearl, which carpets the black ground, is
                  characteristic of Nanban export lacquerware. Export pieces
                  often feature&nbsp;<em>raden</em>, a mother-of-pearl technique in
                  which thin pieces of shell are affixed to a wooden base,
                  leveled with layers of lacquer, and polished to reveal their
                  iridescence. For export, workshops adopted more expedient and
                  cost-effective methods, adding greater quantities of animal
                  glue, reducing the number of lacquer layers, and blending
                  native&nbsp;urushi&nbsp;with imported&nbsp;<em>thitsi</em>&nbsp;lacquer from
                  Southeast Asia.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-06luterbacher-final-fn17" id="page-06luterbacher-final-fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup>
                  The resulting dense, shimmering decoration catered to Iberian
                  tastes and mirrored other export items that traveled along the
                  Portuguese trade routes, such as Indian furniture and
                  textiles.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-06luterbacher-final-fn18" id="page-06luterbacher-final-fnref18" class="footnote-ref-anchor">18</a></sup>

                  Export shrines reflected the increased mobility of sacred
                  images amid the Counter-Reformation’s global aims. Iberian
                  expansion and the universal Catholic missionary enterprise
                  facilitated the circulation of religious imagery while
                  intensifying ecclesiastical efforts to control sacred
                  boundaries. In response to Protestant iconoclasm, the Council
                  of Trent (1545–63) reaffirmed the instructional value of
                  religious images yet advocated strict oversight to distinguish
                  sacred from profane content.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-06luterbacher-final-fn19" id="page-06luterbacher-final-fnref19" class="footnote-ref-anchor">19</a></sup>
                  Believed to be powerful tools for proselytization across
                  linguistic divides, the appearance, display, and use of
                  religious images in rituals remained a constant concern in the
                  overseas missions—especially in East Asia, where Jesuits’
                  accommodative strategies heightened fears that adapting
                  Christian rituals and visual culture to foreign contexts might
                  dilute or alter their content.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-06luterbacher-final-fn20" id="page-06luterbacher-final-fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup>
                  In Japan, Jesuits imported European prints and paintings,
                  appealing to Japanese concepts of iconicity. The mission later
                  enlisted the Italian Jesuit painter Giovanni Cola (Niccolò) to
                  produce religious artworks as well as to train Japanese
                  novices in a painting seminary to replicate European models,
                  ensuring strict control over form, style, and iconography to
                  prevent semantic slippage.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-06luterbacher-final-fn21" id="page-06luterbacher-final-fnref21" class="footnote-ref-anchor">21</a></sup>
                  As Alexandra Curvelo has suggested, the Jesuit enterprise
                  likened the copying of religious images to Christian
                  conversion, one that, in their view, proposed a sacred
                  transmission across cultural frontiers, materialized through a
                  seamless process of replication and made manifest in the
                  artworks themselves.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-06luterbacher-final-fn22" id="page-06luterbacher-final-fnref22" class="footnote-ref-anchor">22</a></sup>

                  Framing strategies played a key role in seamlessly integrating
                  religious images into the portable ornamental shrines that
                  housed them. Export shrines could function as both physical
                  and metaphorical framing devices for religious images,
                  mediating shifting cultural and geographic mobilities during
                  an era of global Catholicism and post-Tridentine regulation.
                  In this regard, the shrines resonated with contemporaneous
                  European “inset images” (<em>Einsatzbilder</em>), sacred
                  images within ornamental frames linked to Counter-Reformation
                  principles of decorum. This seamless integration of the image
                  into its surrounds is evident in Flemish garland paintings,
                  such as the 1608 collaboration between Jan Brueghel and
                  Hendrick van Balen for Cardinal Federico Borromeo (fig. 2).
                  Balen’s oil-on-silver Virgin and Child is framed by Brueghel’s
                  floral garland, painted in oil on panel, emphasizing Marian
                  themes of divine beauty and natural abundance. The composite
                  painting employs the “smooth manner,” long championed by
                  Netherlandish artists and theorists, a technique that conceals
                  brushwork beneath fine layers of oil paint to evoke the image
                  “not made by human hands.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-06luterbacher-final-fn23" id="page-06luterbacher-final-fnref23" class="footnote-ref-anchor">23</a></sup>
                  This style elevated the artist’s work to the level of the
                  divine by obscuring its manufactured origins. According to
                  Victor Stoichita, the religious icon, set within an
                  illusionistic frame, mediates the escalating tensions between
                  the cult image and the authored artwork, striving to preserve
                  its dual status as both a devotional image and a commodity
                  within a burgeoning art market.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-06luterbacher-final-fn24" id="page-06luterbacher-final-fnref24" class="footnote-ref-anchor">24</a></sup>
                  Similarly, the Sardoal shrine integrates distinct artistic
                  contributions into a seamlessly fabricated, unified artwork,
                  merging oil-on-copper icon and lacquered ornamental frame. In
                  doing so, it reflects a Jesuit missionary paradigm that
                  attempted to safeguard the icon’s sacred integrity while
                  incorporating local artistic practices and traditional
                  Japanese floral and faunal ornamentation.

                  The combinatory aesthetics of the framed icon informed other
                  types of art that traveled via the Manila Galleon route. New
                  Spanish feather work (<em>plumería</em>) offers a key example.
                  These intricate works, made from exotic bird plumage arranged
                  into elaborate and colorful designs, had long adorned the
                  shields and ceremonial vestments of nobles, warriors, and
                  sacrificial victims within the Mexica (Aztec) empire. In the
                  early decades of Spanish colonization, feather artists (known
                  in Nahuatl as&nbsp;<em>amanteca</em>) adapted Indigenous materials
                  and methods to produce Christian icons. By the seventeenth
                  century, feather works had become part of a larger global
                  trade network. The Tokyo National Museum holds an outstanding
                  example set into a Japanese export lacquered shrine (fig. 3).
                  Beneath a glass panel, a feather work Saint Stephen kneels in
                  prayer beneath three assailants’ raised stones. Powdered gold
                  and encrusted shell give shape to maple trees and deer
                  spreading across its open hinged doors in a landscape that
                  both frames and continues the central scene. Although the icon
                  has lost its original brilliance, a recent technical analysis
                  led by Hiroshige Okada at Osaka University suggests that it is
                  a high-quality work produced in the first half of the
                  seventeenth century.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-06luterbacher-final-fn25" id="page-06luterbacher-final-fnref25" class="footnote-ref-anchor">25</a></sup>
                  It showcases feathers, many of which can be identified as
                  hummingbird, glued against paper attached to an unknown
                  support, along with other strips of gold and colored
                  paper.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-06luterbacher-final-fn26" id="page-06luterbacher-final-fnref26" class="footnote-ref-anchor">26</a></sup>
                  The feather work scene within the Tokyo shrine features a
                  composition, style, and techniques that align with those of
                  feather works attributed to seventeenth-century Purépecha
                  workshops in Michoacán, such as the Saint John the Evangelist
                  icon at the Denver Art Museum (fig. 4).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-06luterbacher-final-fn27" id="page-06luterbacher-final-fnref27" class="footnote-ref-anchor">27</a></sup>
                  Although the Tokyo shrine’s inserted glass panel appears
                  machine-made and thus indicates some element of later modern
                  intervention, there remain convincing reasons to believe that
                  the shrine and its feather work were combined in colonial-era
                  Mexico.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-06luterbacher-final-fn28" id="page-06luterbacher-final-fnref28" class="footnote-ref-anchor">28</a></sup>

                  Feather works and lacquerware circulated between Asia and the
                  Americas throughout the early modern period. The lacquer
                  objects discussed here show interventions along the Manila
                  Galleon route and in Spanish colonial America. American
                  feathers, meanwhile, were already prized in sixteenth-century
                  Japan: In 1585, Pedro Gómez, Jesuit superior of the Japanese
                  mission, requested from the archbishop of Évora “some small or
                  large feathered image (<em>imagem de pena</em>) from the
                  Castilian Indies,” noting their high value among the
                  Japanese.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-06luterbacher-final-fn29" id="page-06luterbacher-final-fnref29" class="footnote-ref-anchor">29</a></sup>
                  This Iberian discourse on feather works ran parallel to
                  contemporaneous discussions on lacquer. Feather artists in New
                  Spanish Franciscan workshops created Christian images based on
                  European prints, echoing practices from the Jesuit Japanese
                  seminary described earlier. The&nbsp;amanteca&nbsp;also adapted their
                  techniques for broader export markets, emphasizing specific
                  materials and visual effects that parallel the strategies of
                  Japanese lacquer artisans working for foreign trade.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-06luterbacher-final-fn30" id="page-06luterbacher-final-fnref30" class="footnote-ref-anchor">30</a></sup>

                  Framing appears to have been a crucial concern in colonial
                  feather works from their earliest production.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-06luterbacher-final-fn31" id="page-06luterbacher-final-fnref31" class="footnote-ref-anchor">31</a></sup>
                  As Luisa Elena Alcalá has argued, feathered images attributed
                  to the seventeenth century exhibit consistent compositions and
                  dimensions that reflect a broader trend toward standardization
                  in private devotional works.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-06luterbacher-final-fn32" id="page-06luterbacher-final-fnref32" class="footnote-ref-anchor">32</a></sup>
                  Many of these feather works display an integrated frame
                  decorated with strips of paper and floral decorations made of
                  incised colored feathers. The integrated frame delineates
                  representational space and reinforces the central scene’s
                  sacred status, recalling the dynamic that the European
                  Einsatzbilder established between central icons and their
                  painted floral surrounds. Alcalá also suggests that the
                  feathered frames echo other inlay techniques that were prized
                  for their smooth, integrative aesthetic, such as the seamless
                  assembly of finely cut, colored stones known as
                  <em>pietre dure</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-06luterbacher-final-fn33" id="page-06luterbacher-final-fnref33" class="footnote-ref-anchor">33</a></sup>
                  In the Tokyo shrine, a rectangular frame with makie scrollwork
                  surrounding the Saint Stephen scene conceals most of its
                  feathered ornamental frame (today, only strips of gilt and red
                  paper bordering can be seen at the picture’s top and bottom,
                  fig. 5).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-06luterbacher-final-fn34" id="page-06luterbacher-final-fnref34" class="footnote-ref-anchor">34</a></sup>
                  The integrated frame highlights the artwork’s meticulous
                  arrangement of precisely incised colored feathers into a
                  unified and polished composition.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The lacquered shrine from the Tokyo National Museum
                  effectively adds <em>another</em> frame to the feathered
                  image, combining various craft techniques and elemental
                  materials from land, sea, and air under the Christian icon’s
                  auspices. The feathered icon’s background landscape continues
                  onto the lacquer doors to articulate martyrdom as an act of
                  territorial conversion, transforming the lush lacquer
                  vegetation into consecrated ground, merging lacquer and
                  feather work, icon and container, into a single Christian
                  artifact. Feather clouds continue in golden makie to form a
                  horizontal skyline on the adjacent doors, while the rolling
                  hills transform into sprouting maple trees with stags and a
                  doe. Local and auspicious flora and fauna in lacquer have come
                  to frame a feathered icon that reciprocally sanctifies the
                  landscape as a site of Christian martyrdom. It seems to reach
                  for the Flemish garland painting’s gesture of natural
                  abundance, anticipating the garlands as emblems of a nature
                  tamed by artistic skill, blooms harvested and arranged into
                  luxurious ornaments of devotion—in this case, Japanese
                  vegetation primed to serve as the missionary project’s newest
                  garden for a growing faith.

                <p>
                  Framing dynamics deployed in lacquer and feathers partook of a
                  broader strategy in missionary artistic rhetoric. Sources on
                  the Iberian reception of lacquerware and feather work
                  emphasize smooth facture as a wondrous, quasi-miraculous,
                  artisanal achievement, yet they also underscore how this
                  appearance of seamlessness often derived, paradoxically, from
                  the concealment of the hands that had accomplished it.

                  The Spanish Jesuit missionary and natural historian José de
                  Acosta (1540–1600) commented on colonial feather works in
                  terms strikingly similar to his Portuguese contemporary Fróis:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    In New Spain, there is an abundance of birds with excellent
                    plumage, whose delicacy cannot be found in Europe, as can be
                    seen from the feather pictures that come from there . . . a
                    work so delicate and so smooth [<em>tan delicada, y tan ygual</em>] that it seems to be painted in colors that even the brush
                    and dyes cannot surpass.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-06luterbacher-final-fn35" id="page-06luterbacher-final-fnref35" class="footnote-ref-anchor">35</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Acosta establishes a <em>paragone</em> (comparison) in which
                  feather work surpasses painting’s illusionistic potential. He
                  describes the smoothness of the work using the term
                  <em>igual</em>, emphasizing the uniform surface of densely
                  packed feathers. Both Fróis and Acosta praise the skillful
                  assembly of disparate parts into a unified surface, a
                  discourse familiar to many European arts of the sixteenth
                  century.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-06luterbacher-final-fn36" id="page-06luterbacher-final-fnref36" class="footnote-ref-anchor">36</a></sup>
                  As a missionary order, the Jesuits emerged as fervent
                  chroniclers of the “non-manufactured” image, their words
                  tracing an evolving rhetorical vocabulary of facture that
                  intertwined with the Jesuits’ global pursuits in
                  antiquarianism and natural history.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-06luterbacher-final-fn37" id="page-06luterbacher-final-fnref37" class="footnote-ref-anchor">37</a></sup>
                  The prizing of seamless manufacture would eventually extend
                  into a notion of “assemblage” writ large, with arts from
                  different kingdoms merging into a single artwork.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Moreover, “seamlessness” could describe a facture so perfect
                  that it might even trick the eyes, yielding a visual
                  impression that might be confirmed by the tactile effect of
                  “smoothness.” Acosta recalls how Pope Sixtus V tested the
                  surface of a feathered image representing Saint Francis, which
                  he had been gifted, by “softly passing his fingers over the
                  picture to see if it was indeed made of feathers. He thought
                  it marvelous that they were so well set [within the picture]
                  that sight could not determine whether they were natural
                  colors of feathers or artificial colors painted with a
                  brush.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-06luterbacher-final-fn38" id="page-06luterbacher-final-fnref38" class="footnote-ref-anchor">38</a></sup>
                  For Acosta, the determinative capabilities of touch surpass
                  those of vision. At first glance, the densely arrayed feathers
                  confound discernment between nature and artifice.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-06luterbacher-final-fn39" id="page-06luterbacher-final-fnref39" class="footnote-ref-anchor">39</a></sup>
                  For both Acosta and Fróis, the object’s surface mediates
                  sensory contemplation of its own manufacture while never fully
                  disclosing the fabrication process. Fróis describes the
                  lacquer object in similar terms, emphasizing the secrecy of
                  its making.

                  Jesuit missionaries recognized in Japan the familiar elements
                  of a stratified society with its own artisanal class, the
                  <em>shokunin</em>. Not unlike the European guilds, artisanal
                  production in Japan was generally a generational, familial,
                  and male-led enterprise (known as <em>ie</em>, “household”),
                  administered by a master craftsman whose knowledge was
                  carefully safeguarded and transmitted only to workshop
                  members.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-06luterbacher-final-fn40" id="page-06luterbacher-final-fnref40" class="footnote-ref-anchor">40</a></sup>
                  Eiko Ikegami describes the shokunin’s skill or mastery (<em>gei</em>
                  or <em>geinō</em>) as a magical technology or ability “to move
                  or influence nature and to connect this present world with the
                  unseen world beyond.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-06luterbacher-final-fn41" id="page-06luterbacher-final-fnref41" class="footnote-ref-anchor">41</a></sup>
                  The Japanese lacquerer’s ability to not just transform toxic
                  sap into a hard, smooth surface but also to integrate
                  brilliant materials, aligns with the shokunin’s near-magical
                  harnessing of natural forces and ties to the spiritual realm.
                  Comparatively, the amanteca’s artful use of iridescent
                  feathers was associated with a spiritual essence, known in
                  Nahuatl as&nbsp;<em>tonalli</em>, and was later adapted to
                  Christian imagery.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-06luterbacher-final-fn42" id="page-06luterbacher-final-fnref42" class="footnote-ref-anchor">42</a></sup>
                  Indeed, praised by Catholic missionaries, the invisible
                  handiwork of lacquerers and feather artists was conditioned by
                  a careful balance between revealing and concealing, between
                  the mastery and mystery of their artistry.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-06luterbacher-final-fn43" id="page-06luterbacher-final-fnref43" class="footnote-ref-anchor">43</a></sup>
                  The missionaries’ noted admiration of a non-European technique
                  went beyond neutral aesthetic appreciation; it reflected a
                  desire to access the artisan’s secret, even magical knowledge,
                  and repurpose it for global aims. Whether in Fróis’s praise of
                  lacquer as a reliquary or Acosta’s account of feather work
                  transformed into a Christian icon, both missionaries attested
                  to the sacred efficacy embedded in these artistic media.

                  The dynamic interplay of revelation and concealment inherent
                  in the seamless surface persisted through the transpacific
                  circulation of religious art well into the eighteenth
                  century.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-06luterbacher-final-fn44" id="page-06luterbacher-final-fnref44" class="footnote-ref-anchor">44</a></sup>
                  An export lacquer shrine from the Daniel Liebsohn Collection
                  in Mexico City speaks to the continuation of this phenomenon
                  between the Americas and Asia via the Manila Galleon circuit
                  (fig. 6). The shrine’s lacquered doors open to reveal a
                  striking visual palimpsest: a resplendent eighteenth-century
                  oil-on-copper painting of the Virgin of Guadalupe embedded
                  within a seventeenth-century Japanese lacquer shrine, itself
                  imported a century earlier. Affixed to the rear of the shrine
                  is an inscribed piece of paper, an indulgence granted to those
                  who pray before the image, issued by the bishop of Calahorra
                  and La Calzada and dated November 15, 1786, in the Basque town
                  of Mondragón (Gipuzkoa).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-06luterbacher-final-fn45" id="page-06luterbacher-final-fnref45" class="footnote-ref-anchor">45</a></sup>
                  This Atlantic addition overlays yet another vector of
                  circulation upon the shrine’s Pacific trajectories. The
                  gifting of Guadalupe images to Basque-speaking regions was a
                  common colonial practice, reflecting the enduring ties between
                  Basque emigrants to New Spain and their home communities in
                  Northern Spain.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-06luterbacher-final-fn46" id="page-06luterbacher-final-fnref46" class="footnote-ref-anchor">46</a></sup>
                  The shrine once again merges diverse artistic traditions,
                  while also reflecting the continued preservation and reuse of
                  export lacquerware in the colonial period.

                  Cherubim wrought in American silver surround the central icon,
                  accompanied by four small painted scenes of the Virgin’s
                  miraculous apparition, affixed to the lacquer doors. Following
                  period protocols for depicting the Guadalupe, they
                  sequentially capture her apparition to the Indigenous witness
                  Juan Diego and her command to gather roses in his cloak.
                  Appearing before Mexico’s first bishop, Diego spills the
                  flowers to reveal the Virgin’s image miraculously impressed
                  into the cloth. By the seventeenth century, the apparition
                  narrative had supplanted the account of an Indigenous painter
                  Marcos Cipac de Aquino’s authorship, reflecting the imposed
                  layering that shaped artistic production in New Spain: a
                  Catholic icon materialized in an Indigenous substrate—a cloak
                  (<em>tilma</em>) of&nbsp;<em>ayate</em>&nbsp;(<em>ayatl</em>) cloth
                  woven from local maguey or palm fibers. In the Liebsohn
                  shrine, floral decoration and painted scenes engender a
                  missionary myth of seamless overlay.

                  As recently explored by Derek S. Burdette, viceregal artists
                  served as the prime investigators in determining the
                  Guadalupe’s divine origins.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-06luterbacher-final-fn47" id="page-06luterbacher-final-fnref47" class="footnote-ref-anchor">47</a></sup>
                  The artists who inspected the image in the seventeenth and
                  eighteenth centuries insisted on the miraculous nature of the
                  surface’s painted smoothness, in specific contrast with the
                  “roughness” of the native ayate fabric.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-06luterbacher-final-fn48" id="page-06luterbacher-final-fnref48" class="footnote-ref-anchor">48</a></sup>
                  For example, the famed New Spanish painter Miguel Cabrera
                  emphasized its miraculous smoothness in his&nbsp;<em>Maravilla americana</em>, an examination of the picture published in 1756, drawing
                  deeply on Jesuit discourse that framed the image as a divine
                  imprint beyond human artistry.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-06luterbacher-final-fn49" id="page-06luterbacher-final-fnref49" class="footnote-ref-anchor">49</a></sup>
                  He writes:
                </p>
                <blockquote>

                    What should provoke admiration is the softness
                    [<em>suavidad</em>] experienced in this ayate; for all the
                    roughness it presents to the eye, which one would expect
                    from being made of such ordinary material, is converted to
                    the touch into a gentle smoothness very similar to that of
                    fine silk, as I have found on the many occasions I have had
                    the good fortune to touch it; and certainly the other ayates
                    of its kind do not enjoy this privilege.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-06luterbacher-final-fn50" id="page-06luterbacher-final-fnref50" class="footnote-ref-anchor">50</a></sup>

                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Cabrera describes the “ordinary matter” of the cloth as a
                  rough and crude ground transformed into a soft, painted
                  surface. He thus witnesses the miracle through the tactile
                  experience of its conversion from roughness into smoothness.
                  The smooth, seamless surface affirms the image’s divine
                  creation while simultaneously concealing the “roughness” of
                  Native craft, and, by extension, its Indigenous
                  authorship.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-06luterbacher-final-fn51" id="page-06luterbacher-final-fnref51" class="footnote-ref-anchor">51</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In closing, it is worth noting that in seeking to describe the
                  tactile effects of the Guadalupe’s miraculous materiality,
                  Cabrera opted for a comparison to the handmade commodity of
                  fine silk. Asian export silk, a lifeblood of transpacific
                  commerce, unfurled across colonial society to adorn its
                  interiors and bodies alike. Like lacquer, silk’s shining
                  surface captured the Iberian imagination of wonderfully
                  seamless, effortless manufacture. Yet beneath this smoothness
                  lay the entangled histories of transpacific labor and the many
                  skilled hands that shaped such artworks’ sheen. The rhetoric
                  of seamlessness enabled these objects to inhabit disparate,

                  That miraculous facture could be seamlessly converted from the
                  acheiropoieton to the merchandise item announces the object’s
                  new commodified status on the eve of the industrial age. Where
                  commerce and religion intersect, the sacred does not so much
                  disappear as become appropriated and generalized within the
                  world of goods, consumption practices, and tastes—surface, in
                  turn, emerges as the primary site for a modern aesthetic
                  judgment sustained by imperceptible labor. In this interplay
                  of revelation and concealment, one glimpses a defining paradox
                  of the early modern world in which artisanal skill was both
                  desired and dissimulated within global imperial economies,
                  outshined by the gleam of an immaculate facade.

                        ivory carvings of Chinese migrants in Manila, such as a
                        crucifix from the Dominican monastery of San Esteban in
                        Salamanca with an ivory Christ on a Nanban lacquer
                        cross.

                  With the consolidation of the maritime commercial route of the
                  Manila Galleon in 1565, innovative artistic forms were
                  introduced to New Spain. These objects—including porcelain,
                  lacquer, and silks—quickly had an impact on local taste. Among
                  these novel objects were <em>biombos</em>, or folding screens,
                  Japanese imports that were soon adapted by local artists to
                  New Spanish tastes. In the seventeenth and eighteenth
                  centuries, the folding screen became a symbol of refinement
                  and an almost ubiquitous feature of colonial interiors.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Folding screens were then reinvented in the twentieth century
                  by Mexican modern interior designers and architects. Some drew
                  on the biombo’s links to the colonial past, while other
                  designers saw them as modernist pieces of furniture, stripped
                  down to their barest elements. In Mexico, both of these ways
                  of understanding the biombo were influenced by history,
                  reinforced by famed and prominent screens that were being
                  collected or displayed in museums as national treasures.
                </p>

                  This essay identifies three ways in which to explore the
                  biombo in modern interiors. First, antique screens appeared in
                  modern interiors as status objects that reaffirmed their
                  owners’ links to the colonial past. Second, biombos were used
                  as supports for artistic expressions that sought to vindicate
                  Mexican folk arts and traditions: In this case, the format of
                  the screen itself may have contributed to the perceived
                  Mexicanness of the object (in other words, these artists may
                  have seen the biombo as a traditionally Mexican support).
                  Finally, modern screens were stripped of their most obvious
                  references to the past or tradition: Lacking iconography, they
                  became vehicles for different architectural and material
                  discourses. At the same time, their function changed, and they
                  were sometimes transformed into a fixed architectural element,
                  becoming an extension of the building and abandoning the
                  portability that had originally contributed to their
                  popularity.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Origins</strong></p>
                <p>
                  The word “biombo” is a corruption of the Japanese
                  <em>byōbu</em> (wind wall), and it remains the only term used
                  in Mexico today, demonstrating its enduring link to Asia.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-11rojas-final-fn1" id="page-11rojas-final-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                  Folding screens were first introduced to the Iberian world as
                  diplomatic gifts from Japanese envoys in the sixteenth and
                  early seventeenth centuries and were soon shipped across the
                  Pacific via the Manila Galleon to eager consumers in New
                  Spain.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-11rojas-final-fn2" id="page-11rojas-final-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                  The first screens to arrive were made of layered paper
                  stretched over a wooden frame and adorned with ink washes and
                  gold ornamentation, trimmed by lacquer and silk edging. Almost
                  immediately on arriving in the Mexican capital, local artists
                  began to reinvent the Japanese screen according to local
                  tastes using readily available materials like cotton canvas
                  and oil paints.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-11rojas-final-fn3" id="page-11rojas-final-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                  In the hands of New Spain’s painters, biombos became important
                  supports for secular subjects in the seventeenth and
                  eighteenth centuries, in contrast to the religious themes that
                  otherwise predominated. They often featured historical scenes
                  like the Conquest of Mexico, literary characters, mythological
                  allegories, landscapes, and scenes of leisurely life (<em>fêtes galantes</em>), but they could also be covered with decorative patterns,
                  especially on the reverse face. Because they were typically
                  painted with complex iconographic programs, biombos were
                  considered art objects rather than furniture in the colonial
                  period.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-11rojas-final-fn4" id="page-11rojas-final-fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Whether made locally or imported, the screens’ association
                  with not only the luxury and fantasy of Asia but also elevated
                  rank and courtly power made them attractive to the newly
                  enriched nobility of New Spain, and their popularity radiated
                  outward to the rest of colonial society. They were hallmarks
                  of the remarkable cosmopolitanism of New Spanish consumers,
                  and to own one was an explicit statement of that
                  sophistication. Within the colonial home, biombos were
                  typically placed around the <em>estrado</em>, a women’s
                  sitting room that often displayed a family’s most luxurious
                  objects. Biombos became such an important part of interior
                  design that they were portrayed in several
                  <em>ex-votos</em> and <em>casta</em> paintings. One such
                  example can be seen in an eighteenth-century ex-voto where the
                  biombo serves to protect a patient undergoing surgery (fig.
                  1). The pictured eight-leaf lacquered screen tells us how
                  established the use of this object was by the eighteenth
                  century, as well as its position and scale within the home.

                  While the biombo never lost its link to Asia—in 1726, the
                  <em>Diccionario de Autoridades</em> still noted: “It is a
                  treasure that came to us from China or Japan” (<em>Es alhaja que nos vino modernamente de la China o Japón</em>)—its reinterpretation by local artists transformed it into a
                  fundamentally New Spanish object.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-11rojas-final-fn5" id="page-11rojas-final-fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>
                  With the end of the galleon trade, the fashion for Asian goods
                  diminished, and over the course of the nineteenth century, the
                  production of biombos rapidly declined. Biombos ceased to be
                  decorated with sophisticated programs drawn from mythology or
                  landscape painting, instead becoming folk objects featuring
                  phytomorphic or abstract decorations.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Repurposing Antique Screens</strong></p>
                <p>
                  Until rather recently, historians of Mexican furniture—few
                  though they were—paid less attention to the biombo than to
                  furnishings like chests, chairs, or tables. Abelardo Carrillo
                  y Gariel’s <em>Evolución del mueble en México</em> (1957) was
                  one of the first studies to trace a continuous and convincing
                  history of furniture in Mexico, including prehispanic
                  versions. He focused on chairs and other seating and relegated
                  the screen to the end of the book, including only three
                  examples. One of them is a famous eighteenth-century biombo
                  depicting a <em>sarao</em> (a type of courtly dance) in a
                  garden by Miguel Gerónimo Zendejas (1724–1815), now in the
                  National Museum of History in Mexico City. While undoubtedly
                  an important artwork, Gariel ignores other examples of great
                  historical importance and omits references to the evolution of
                  the biombo, which he includes for chairs and tables.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-11rojas-final-fn6" id="page-11rojas-final-fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>
                  This is common in publications dedicated to the history of
                  Mexican furniture at mid-century: The biombo is acknowledged
                  as an important historic object, but without information on
                  its development, it appears immutable. Only later would
                  designers and historians acknowledge the evolution of screens
                  and their links to contemporary production.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This early history reminds us that one way the painted biombo
                  was incorporated into modern Mexican interior design was as an
                  antique. Considered both a work of art and a relic of the
                  past, the screen lost its function of demarcating space within
                  the home. Instead, these objects were displayed as symbols of
                  high social status, protagonists in the construction of
                  interiors that sought to project tradition and aristocratic
                  ancestry. For those not lucky or wellborn enough to inherit
                  one, biombos were readily available from Mexico City’s antique
                  dealers. An alternative was to install a neocolonial screen of
                  contemporary manufacture. In either case, these screens shared
                  the same purpose: explicitly claiming the prestige associated
                  with colonial institutions of power such as the Church or the
                  Crown, in direct opposition to the post-revolutionary
                  discourses that privileged the prehispanic past and the
                  Indigenous origins of Mexico as the foundation of a national
                  identity.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-11rojas-final-fn7" id="page-11rojas-final-fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  A good example of the use of the biombo as a legitimizing
                  element of class and social status can be found in the house
                  of Manuel Barbachano, a famous film producer and director.
                  Located in San Ángel, a colonial village in the southern part
                  of Mexico City, it was decorated in 1957 by the noted interior
                  designer Arturo Pani (1915–1981). He often drew inspiration
                  from eighteenth-century rococo and nineteenth-century Beaux
                  Arts traditions, streamlining them rather than copying them
                  slavishly.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-11rojas-final-fn8" id="page-11rojas-final-fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>
                  For the Barbachano house, he continued to reference the past,
                  using a reproduction of the Zendejas sarao biombo to anchor a
                  large interior space (fig. 2). The screen took a leading role
                  at the center of the main room of the house, where its visible
                  position reaffirmed elegance and tradition, referencing a
                  specific antique displayed in a museum dedicated to Mexican
                  history.

                  While designers like Pani left the biombo as a freestanding
                  element, other designers chose to wall-mount biombos,
                  simultaneously reaffirming the screens’ position as artworks
                  while removing their function as partitions. This mode of
                  display emphasizes their iconographic and symbolic messages
                  but also conceals one side of these often dual-faced objects.
                  It was in this manner that interior design books and magazines
                  from mid-century promoted the use of folding screens:
                  displayed flat and transformed into paintings. One magazine
                  stated that once wall-mounted, a biombo could function as “a
                  sort of mural.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-11rojas-final-fn9" id="page-11rojas-final-fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>
                  In designing the house of the elite Corcuera family, José
                  Gómez de Parada installed a ten-panel biombo featuring a scene
                  of a fête galante in Tlalpan and attributed to Miguel Cabrera,
                  against a wall in the dining room alongside a collection of
                  New Spanish masterworks (fig. 3). Other interior designers
                  followed this new way of displaying antiques (fig. 4).

                  Images of mid-century interiors featuring colonial biombos
                  were popularized in a series of books dedicated to Mexican
                  interiors edited by the American architect Verna Cook Shipway
                  and her husband, Warren Shipway, between 1960 and 1970. As
                  Catherine Ettinger has discussed, the Shipways were pioneers,
                  and their books document not only interiors but furniture
                  design, gardens and topiary, and architectural elements in
                  towns like Cuernavaca, Taxco, Guanajuato, and Mexico City,
                  where many American expatriates lived. They promoted a
                  “Mexican” language of interior design in which antiques and
                  religious art coexisted with modern furniture, usually in
                  neocolonial residences, although more modern interiors were
                  sometimes included.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-11rojas-final-fn10" id="page-11rojas-final-fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup>
                  These books are useful not only to see how antiques were being
                  deployed but to know how taste was being shaped for a broad
                  audience and coalescing around a standardized “Mexican
                  interior.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  One book in the series, <em>Mexican Interiors</em> (1962),
                  included sections dedicated to architectural typologies,
                  decoration, crafts, and furniture such as biombos, where
                  colonial and revival examples are shown indistinctly.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-11rojas-final-fn11" id="page-11rojas-final-fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup>
                  Sometimes the two were mixed, creating pastiches where
                  neocolonial wooden screens incorporated retablos or paintings
                  of saints on tin (fig. 5). This is proof of the popularity of
                  the screens and their perceived Mexican quality, which was
                  being exploited by designers and collectors to forge an
                  interior design style that bridged the modern and colonial
                  periods.

                  In the 1970s, antique biombos also appeared in the country’s
                  leading design magazine:
                  <em>Diseño. Sugerencias para Vivir Mejor</em> (Design: Ideas
                  for better living) (1969–75), the first Mexican publication
                  dedicated to interior design. While short-lived, the magazine
                  was a beacon for freedom of speech amid the official
                  repression against students and political dissidents in this
                  period: It portrayed interiors of all social classes but
                  frequently highlighted the homes of members of Mexico’s art
                  world.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-11rojas-final-fn12" id="page-11rojas-final-fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup>
                  <em>Diseño</em> showed folding screens in several issues,
                  including a photo essay featuring the Barbachano home, proof
                  of the continued relevancy of both Pani’s interior design and
                  biombos to a wide audience (fig. 6).

                  The biombo was promoted as a useful element in interior
                  decoration, as well as an example of what to collect. It was
                  so ubiquitous that the editors even published instructions for
                  how to make one’s own folding screen, noting its long history
                  as a type of furniture.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-11rojas-final-fn13" id="page-11rojas-final-fnref13" class="footnote-ref-anchor">13</a></sup>
                  In another essay focused on biombos, published in August 1970,
                  the magazine explained the two roles of these screens, both
                  traditional and current:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    In classic interiors the biombo is, generally, antique and
                    in the case of being a work of art, it gives more relevancy
                    to its surroundings. . . . The concept of the biombo itself
                    and its usefulness have changed a lot in recent times, it is
                    no longer just a means of protecting something from prying
                    eyes. At present, it is an element of decoration with a life
                    of its own that is used in different ways.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-11rojas-final-fn14" id="page-11rojas-final-fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup>

                <p><strong>The Biombo as Support</strong></p>
                <p>
                  Although <em>japonisme</em> had been an important part of
                  colonial Mexican visual culture, the renewed fervor for Japan
                  that struck the West in the nineteenth century did not find
                  fertile ground in Mexico. By the beginning of the twentieth
                  century, only a few of its intellectuals had visited Japan,
                  and the influence of the Asian nation on design and
                  architecture was negligible. The multi-hyphenate José Juan
                  Tablada (poet, art critic, diplomat, and journalist) was a
                  rare exception, and while his enthusiasm for Japanese art and
                  culture was great, it was not part of a larger wave.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-11rojas-final-fn15" id="page-11rojas-final-fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup>
                  The relevance of the biombo in this period resulted from its
                  position as an icon of Mexican material culture rather than as
                  a Japanese export.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Early-twentieth-century artists used the format of the biombo
                  as a support for more nationalist artistic expressions. One of
                  the earliest examples of this impulse is a 1929 screen by
                  Roberto Montenegro (1885–1968), one of the pioneers of the
                  muralist movement in the early 1920s and a close collaborator
                  of José Vasconcelos, Secretary of Public Education and
                  intellectual architect of the new Mexican art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-11rojas-final-fn16" id="page-11rojas-final-fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup>
                  Across six panels, Montenegro depicted a map of the Mexican
                  Republic in which images of popular arts, flora and fauna, and
                  typical dances are placed across the landscape, as if they
                  were part of the Mexican geography (fig. 7). A direct
                  prototype was the work of nineteenth-century cartographer
                  Antonio García Cubas, who used this strategy to depict
                  Mexico’s resources and encourage economic development, partly
                  for foreign audiences.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-11rojas-final-fn17" id="page-11rojas-final-fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup>
                  As Delia Cosentino and Adriana Zavala have shown, the use of a
                  screen was a way of elevating the popular arts (illustrated on
                  the map) to the field of fine arts, a crucial part of the
                  post-revolutionary discourse that shaped the early years of
                  Mexican muralism.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-11rojas-final-fn18" id="page-11rojas-final-fnref18" class="footnote-ref-anchor">18</a></sup>
                  This biombo was painted the same year that Montenegro,
                  together with diplomat Moisés Sáenz, founded the Museum of
                  Popular Arts in Mexico City. This work would affirm the status
                  of the biombo as a Mexican folk art object divorced from its
                  Japanese origins.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-11rojas-final-fn19" id="page-11rojas-final-fnref19" class="footnote-ref-anchor">19</a></sup>

                  Montenegro repeated this formula in 1951: Across four panels,
                  he reproduced a lithograph of the bay of Acapulco from 1628, a
                  work by Dutch artist Adrian Boot (). Montenegro even copied
                  the cartouche—an element present in colonial biombos that
                  narrated battles or showed local fiestas—that held a legend to
                  the map. In doing so, Montenegro referenced the tradition of
                  mestizo and Indigenous artists in New Spain who reproduced
                  European designs entirely, including cartouches and other
                  editorial details like engravers’ signatures.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-11rojas-final-fn20" id="page-11rojas-final-fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup>

                  Another of these pictorial screens was painted by the
                  Austro-American artist, curator, and collector René
                  d’Harnoncourt. D’Harnoncourt arrived in Mexico in 1925, where
                  he met the antiquarian and dealer Frederick Davis, with whom
                  he traveled the country buying and studying antiques and
                  popular arts.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-11rojas-final-fn21" id="page-11rojas-final-fnref21" class="footnote-ref-anchor">21</a></sup>
                  Painted in 1931, <em>View of Miacatlán</em> measures about
                  five feet tall and shows the bucolic and idealized Indigenous
                  village of Miacatlán, located in the state of Morelos, south
                  of Mexico City. D’Harnoncourt emphasized the traditional
                  houses and local residents, ignoring the seventeenth-century
                  church and nineteenth-century buildings in the town. An
                  inscription at the bottom of the biombo recalls less the
                  cartouches on colonial screens than those on popular ex-votos
                  that detail miraculous events. D’Harnoncourt was certainly
                  familiar with the ex-voto tradition, since he included several
                  examples in the exhibition <em>Mexican Arts</em> that he
                  curated for The Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1930. He
                  included no biombos in that show but surely knew of them
                  through Davis’s shop.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-11rojas-final-fn22" id="page-11rojas-final-fnref22" class="footnote-ref-anchor">22</a></sup>
                  It recalls colonial biombos showing Indigenous life, like the
                  famous seventeenth-century screen at the Los Angeles County
                  Museum of Art showing festivities, including
                  <em>voladores</em>, at an Indigenous wedding. In
                  <em>View of Miacatlán</em>, however, d’Harnoncourt mixed
                  colonial and folk art to create something new.

                  In subsequent decades, other artists revisited the biombo as a
                  support full of symbolic and historical meaning. The antique
                  dealer and collector Jesús Reyes Ferreira (1880–1977), known
                  as Chucho Reyes—a leading figure in Mexico City’s art scene at
                  mid-century—created a series of wooden biombos in the
                  1950s.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-11rojas-final-fn23" id="page-11rojas-final-fnref23" class="footnote-ref-anchor">23</a></sup>
                  Reyes decorated them with his characteristic thick and quickly
                  applied brushstrokes, depicting vases and baskets of flowers
                  along with birds in a semiabstract garden (fig. 8). They
                  resemble the works on paper he was creating at the same time
                  (originally designed as wrapping paper for the fragile
                  antiques he sold), which, as in this example, referenced
                  vernacular painting and folk decorations, such as those found
                  on ceramic tiles used in eighteenth-century religious
                  architecture.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Around the same time, other prominent artists such as David
                  Alfaro Siqueiros (1896–1974) were experimenting with the
                  folding screen format. In 1960, Siqueiros was apprehended and
                  imprisoned by the government for his support of union leaders
                  and the Communist Party in a political climate marked by
                  repression and official paranoia. While in prison, he painted
                  several biombos as backdrops for plays staged by the inmates,
                  using them as vehicles for social criticism.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-11rojas-final-fn24" id="page-11rojas-final-fnref24" class="footnote-ref-anchor">24</a></sup>
                  Lacking references to popular arts, Siqueiros relied on the
                  familiarity of the typology in the Mexican collective
                  imagination but also used screens because of their mobile
                  quality, an especially useful feature when applied to set
                  design. In a maquette from 1965, one year after he was
                  released from prison, Siqueiros produced a series of miniature
                  biombos covered with abstract gestural brushwork with thick
                  layers of paint (fig. 9). In these experimental works, the
                  folds of the screens and their freestanding quality served the
                  artist as starting points for spatial exploration, playing
                  with perspective and light.

                  The fact that Siqueiros used the biombo format not only proves
                  the relentless experimental drive of the artist but also the
                  uninterrupted presence of the folding screen in Mexican life.
                  Siqueiros created several of these maquettes, probably as
                  experiments that later influenced major works of architecture
                  like the Polyforum in Mexico City or his studio “La Tallera”
                  in Cuernavaca, where leaning walls with corners at acute
                  angles were intensified by the painter’s abstract
                  compositions. Thus, biombos remained a typology associated
                  with art, constantly being revisited as a support for
                  painting, even for abstract and experimental works of art,
                  only in this case, completely disengaged from domestic
                  interiors.

                <p><strong>The Architectural Screen</strong></p>
                <p>
                  At mid-century, several interior and furniture designers,
                  including Arturo Pani—whose use of antiques has been
                  discussed—and Luis Barragán (1902–1988), whose plain biombos
                  are perhaps the most well-known, brought the screen into the
                  modern home. In the process, they were drained of iconography,
                  and materiality became more important. In their mid-century
                  revival, biombos were considered part of the architectural
                  space, especially their impact on spatial movement and light.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Almost every modern Mexican designer and architect designed at
                  least one biombo; the format proved useful in displaying a
                  versatile vocabulary. Pani, for example, created screens using
                  diverse styles, sometimes looking back to classical
                  Renaissance motifs, while also showing strong influence from
                  the streamlined forms of Scandinavian design. Other designers
                  more explicitly referenced the Asian origins of biombos. The
                  US-born designer Frank Kyle, who moved to Mexico in the early
                  1950s, drew on his interest in Japanese forms and typologies
                  to create several biombos, some featuring hidden joints in
                  unexpected places, brass ornaments, and Japanese imagery. The
                  decorator and designer Eugenio Escudero, a favorite of
                  Mexico’s jet set, was also fond of transforming screens into
                  abstract, transparent, and architectural sculptures.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-11rojas-final-fn25" id="page-11rojas-final-fnref25" class="footnote-ref-anchor">25</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Of all of these modernists, however, it was Barragán who
                  really redefined the screen, making it a key element in his
                  innovative, spare interiors, using it to divide spaces and
                  shift our perception of light. Barragán reinvented antique
                  furniture typologies throughout his career, as in the case of
                  the lectern, which he streamlined in cedar wood while leaving
                  its medieval origins obvious. He also reformulated low chairs
                  of wood and woven palm, Talavera vessels, and even
                  <em>petates</em> (woven bedrolls), making slight changes in
                  proportions and materials but preserving ancestral techniques
                  and functions and displaying them in avant-garde interiors,
                  creating a modern and international language that
                  simultaneously referenced Mexican sources. Barragán abstracted
                  Mexican vernacular furniture with a surprising level of
                  synthesis and sobriety, similar to what Anni Albers did with
                  Mexican textiles or what Clara Porset (1895–1981) did with the
                  traditional <em>butaque</em> seat.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-11rojas-final-fn26" id="page-11rojas-final-fnref26" class="footnote-ref-anchor">26</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In fact, screens play an important role in Barragán’s
                  interiors, where he used them as an articulated extension of
                  the low walls that divide rooms and spaces without
                  interrupting the flow of light reflected across the
                  double-height ceilings. Often considered mere background
                  elements, these screens are crucial to understanding the
                  architect’s interior design, not least because they remain
                  largely <em>in situ</em>, unlike the other screens that have
                  been discussed so far (fig. 10). Indeed, screens were already
                  sited in Barragán’s original floor plan (indicated by zig-zag
                  lines), proving that the architect thought of them as an
                  architectural feature, not to be moved and as important as any
                  wall (fig. 11).

                  Perhaps the first of these screens to be made was the one in
                  the living room in his house-studio in Tacubaya, a historic
                  neighborhood near Chapultepec Park, completed in 1948 (fig.
                  12).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-11rojas-final-fn27" id="page-11rojas-final-fnref27" class="footnote-ref-anchor">27</a></sup>
                  It consists of four panels, each just over eight feet high and
                  just over two feet wide (almost ten feet wide if fully
                  extended). The height of the screen is almost the same as the
                  wall that divides the living room from the entry hall,
                  creating a space reduced in width although without a ceiling,
                  providing intimacy without sacrificing luminosity or the
                  monumentality that the double-height ceiling gives the space.
                  The panels are made of wooden frames covered by sheets of
                  parchment, an old-fashioned translucent material (common in
                  medieval manuscripts) that makes the screen both a reflective
                  surface and a protective wall. Barragán paid close attention
                  to the meaning and history of materials, using them to create
                  a cohesive atmosphere, from the exterior of the unpainted
                  facade to the smallest detail inside. He thus frequently used
                  parchment in his designs, including for lamp shades: Its ivory
                  white color is similar to the raw cotton textiles (<em>manta de cielo</em>) and undecorated white Talavera ceramics that Barragán also
                  favored.

                <p>
                  In the library, Barragán placed another, more modest
                  three-panel screen in which the wooden supports are covered by
                  white “manta.” It measures six-and-a-half feet tall, exactly
                  the same as the wooden wall that projects from the adjacent
                  monumental bookshelf. Here the screen extends the wall and
                  divides the bookshelf, creating a more intimate reading room,
                  equipped with couches, a table, and chairs. The screen also
                  reflects the natural light that enters through a large square
                  window with frosted glass. These elements combined provide the
                  space with an intense but soft light, without shadows or
                  colors that might inhibit reading or distract one from
                  concentration. Two other screens were installed in the more
                  intimate spaces in the upper floor, both made of wood and
                  white manta. Those screens are a bit lower, just under
                  six-and-a-half feet, scaled, perhaps, to the architect, who
                  was just over six feet tall.

                <p>
                  Barragán also designed biombos for houses he built for private
                  clients, where they play the same role as in his own home. The
                  Casa Prieto López, the first he built in the elite housing
                  project known as the Jardines del Pedregal de San Ángel, also
                  completed in 1948, included a six-panel screen covered in
                  fabric, with the same dimensions as the one in his
                  library.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-11rojas-final-fn28" id="page-11rojas-final-fnref28" class="footnote-ref-anchor">28</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  By the mid-1950s, Barragán had mastered the use of biombos as
                  a defining architectural element strategically placed to
                  change light, give privacy, extend walls, and create dialogues
                  with the furniture. In 1955, for the Casa Gálvez, he designed
                  three fabric-covered screens that remain in situ today. We see
                  a standardization of materials, measurements, and function—but
                  not of color. In the main living areas, he used raw white
                  manta, but for a biombo in a reading space, more private and
                  less well-lit, he selected an intense fuchsia fabric. Cristina
                  Gálvez recalls that both the architect and her father (the
                  client) referred to the hedge in the garden as a biombo of
                  jasmines, marking the path to discover the mysterious garden
                  and linking the interiors with the exterior.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-11rojas-final-fn29" id="page-11rojas-final-fnref29" class="footnote-ref-anchor">29</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  For Barragán, the materiality of these screens was of the
                  utmost importance; their materials and handmade facture
                  connected them to folk art and the colonial past, allowing him
                  to modernize tradition. Almost at the same time Barragán was
                  furnishing his house in Tacubaya, Charles (1907–1978) and Ray
                  (1912–1988) Eames were designing their own folding screen but
                  moving in an opposite direction, creating an industrially
                  produced object with uniform and smooth modular plywood sheets
                  joined with hidden hinges. Although the biombo typology was
                  widespread and contemporary designers were using it in
                  different parts of the world, its symbolic charge was
                  different in Mexico, where even in the most abstract examples
                  it was linked to New Spain.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Barragán’s use of screens and their incursion into modernist
                  architectural spaces had a powerful impact on his circle of
                  friends and collaborators. A fuchsia biombo was placed in the
                  renovated house of Chucho Reyes, a project not officially
                  recognized as Barragán’s work but on which both collaborated.
                  Architect Juan Sordo Madaleno (1916–1985), with whom Barragán
                  worked on many projects, also incorporated screens in his
                  interiors, where they guide the flow of users and light. In
                  his office, a heavy folding wooden door partially divided the
                  room (fig.13). This might be thought of as a sort of biombo,
                  now permanently fixed to the wall and continuing the use of
                  natural wood.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-11rojas-final-fn30" id="page-11rojas-final-fnref30" class="footnote-ref-anchor">30</a></sup>

                  This research has also identified the use of biombos in
                  commercial spaces, like the Cine París, built in 1954 by Sordo
                  Madaleno. It was one of the most modern movie theaters at the
                  time, located on the Paseo de la Reforma (it has since been
                  torn down).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-11rojas-final-fn31" id="page-11rojas-final-fnref31" class="footnote-ref-anchor">31</a></sup>
                  A monumental screen divided the bar, which was furnished by
                  Clara Porset, from access to the theater (fig. 14). Unlike
                  those in Barragán’s houses, here the biombo is used as an
                  opaque barrier whose white, square panels serve as a support
                  for reproductions of etchings or drawings by Picasso.

                  The monumental openwork steel screen on the main entrance of
                  the Camino Real Hotel, built in 1968 by architect Ricardo
                  Legorreta (1931–2011) for the Mexico City Olympics, might also
                  be understood in the context of this history of the modern
                  biombo (fig. 15). Legorreta commissioned Mathias Goeritz
                  (1915–1990) to design this feature, which has long been
                  understood in terms of plastic or visual integration, the
                  interrelationship of sculpture and architecture that largely
                  defined mid-century architecture in Mexico. Goeritz created a
                  monumental lattice; although originally black, it later
                  acquired its characteristic bright pink—recalling the fuschia
                  biombos in Barragan’s houses—that mediates between the street
                  and a courtyard that leads to the hotel lobby. Its position is
                  fixed, yet it gives the impression that it is an articulated
                  object that could well move or change position.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-11rojas-final-fn32" id="page-11rojas-final-fnref32" class="footnote-ref-anchor">32</a></sup>

                  Biombos continued to be part of Mexican art history long after
                  the last galleon docked in the port of Acapulco in 1815.
                  Consistently revised and reinvented, the Japanese byōbu
                  quickly became a part of New Spanish identity and therefore of
                  the new Mexican pantheon of objects and supports after the
                  Mexican Revolution, later to be exploited to its limits and
                  finally becoming an abstract and even architectural object
                  thanks to the experimentation of the modern movement in
                  Mexico. Biombos are one of the few testimonies of the intense
                  transpacific trade that is still a part of the Mexican
                  vernacular, a long and ongoing travel with unexpected results.

                        This discussion raged for years among architects and
                        historians. Some found in colonial architecture and
                        furniture design a mixture of European and Indigenous
                        features, making it “a true Mexican style.” As time went
                        on, only the most conservative sectors of society were
                        still building and furnishing homes and office buildings
                        in this fashion, as opposed to the functionalism
                        associated with socialist ideas or, later, following the
                        trend for folk art popular among the jet set. See Jorge
