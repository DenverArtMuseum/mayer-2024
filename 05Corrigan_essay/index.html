      “Brocades of Gold and Silver upon Silk” | Transpacific Crossings
    </title>

    <meta name="description" content="For 250 years (1565–1815), the Manila Galleon transported Asian goods from the Philippines to the Americas under the rule of the Spanish Crown. Stopping in Acapulco, Mexico, the silk, fans, lacquered goods, clothes, and porcelain brought by the galleon rapidly circulated through the Americas, introducing a new visual culture that influenced objects, consumers, makers, and merchants alike. Conversely, products imported from the Americas, such as silver, indigo dye, cochineal red, chili peppers, and corn, had an enormous impact on Asia. Eleven scholars from the United States, Mexico, and Singapore present current research on how the vast exchange of materials, techniques, and ideas between continents impacted the trajectory of art and material culture across the Pacific.">

                  Historians have primarily framed the global networks centered
                  between Asia and the Americas during the early modern era as a
                  “silk for silver” commodity exchange. For centuries, silk was
                  one of the primary luxury goods exported from China to Manila
                  and exchanged there for silver extracted from the
                  astonishingly rich caches at Potosí, in what is today Bolivia.
                  This microhistory of a large set of Catholic church vestments
                  made from Chinese silk explores global circulation during the
                  late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries through an
                  object-focused study of one component of that vast exchange
                  (figs. 1, 2, and 10).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                  This visual, analytical, and archival exploration offers a
                  focused way to better understand Habsburg Spain’s connections
                  to Asia and the world’s first global network.

                  This set of vestments, composed of ten separate elements, was
                  made from a bolt of silk woven in China at some point in the
                  sixteenth or seventeenth centuries (likely between 1580 and
                  1640). The set currently includes two dalmatics (a long
                  priest’s tunic with broad, open sleeves), each with an
                  accompanying collar, a chasuble (a priest’s armless tunic), a
                  stole (a textile band worn around the neck), two maniples (a
                  shorter band worn on the left arm during Mass), a baldachin,
                  and a fragment of unlined cut silk.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                  A chalice veil to cover the communion cup likely originally
                  accompanied the other textiles, but given its small size, it
                  is not surprising that the veil has not survived with the set.
                  A private collector acquired the set in the 1920s from a small
                  church in northern Spain, possibly Séron de Nágima in the
                  province of Soria. Galerie Ruf, a textile dealer in
                  Beckenried, Switzerland, purchased the group of vestments in
                  the 1980s from the son of the collector and, finally, the
                  Peabody Essex Museum (PEM) acquired the set from the gallery
                  in 2001. This is all that we currently know about the set from
                  the archival record, but there are other avenues to unpack the
                  set’s more than four-hundred-year history. A close analysis of
                  the objects themselves can build an informative and
                  interconnected narrative of the set’s long journey from China
                  to Spain and its connection to a larger global history.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Chinese silks were first introduced to the Iberian world via
                  the land-based trade networks connecting Asia with the Middle
                  East. Spanish weavers began incorporating Chinese motifs in
                  their designs as early as the 1300s.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                  But the quantities of Chinese silk that physically arrived in
                  Europe were initially quite limited. More than one thousand
                  patterned silks dating from the seventh to twelfth centuries
                  are preserved in European church treasuries, but only one
                  example is plausibly from China.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                  The initial stylistic impact of Chinese silks in Europe was
                  likely more indirect. European weavers could have adapted
                  their designs from imported Persian and other Central Asian
                  textiles that had been, in turn, influenced by Chinese
                  textiles.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ocean-based trade dramatically changed the volume of
                  Europeans’ direct contact with Chinese silks, at least at the
                  edges of the Spanish Crown’s empire. In 1594, García Hurtado
                  de Mendoza, fourth marquis of Cañete and viceroy of Peru,
                  noted that in the viceroyalties, “Chinese merchandise is so
                  cheap and Spanish goods so dear . . . a man can clothe his
                  wife in Chinese silks for two hundred reales, whereas he could
                  not provide her with clothing of Spanish silks with two
                  hundred pesos.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>
                  The Spanish Crown initially banned the importation of Chinese
                  silks to the viceroyalties in an attempt to protect the
                  Spanish textile industries’ new markets in the Americas. These
                  edicts from the Crown were repeated (and often ignored)
                  throughout the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth
                  centuries. In 1718, after the latest ban was implemented,
                  Baltasar de Zúñiga, viceroy of New Spain, refused to implement
                  it, noting that residents in Mexico preferred the Chinese
                  imports and their relative affordability.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>

                  Silk was imported from China in a variety of forms and levels
                  of quality—raw and floss silk, threads, dyed and undyed bolts
                  of cloth, and woven, embroidered, and painted silks. In
                  <em>Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas</em> (1609), Antonio de
                  Morga, a former lieutenant governor of the Philippines,
                  described the various kinds of Chinese silk imported into
                  Manila:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    Raw silk, in bundles, of the fineness of two strands, and
                    other silk of inferior quality; fine untwisted silks, white
                    and of all colours, in small skeins; quantities of smooth
                    velvets, and velvet embroidered in all sorts of patterns,
                    colours and fashions; and others, with the ground of gold
                    and embroidered with the same; woven cloths and brocades of
                    gold and silver upon silk of various colours and patterns,
                    quantities of gold and silver thread in skeins, upon thread
                    and upon silk, but all the spangles of gold and silver are
                    false and upon paper; damask, satins, taffetas, and
                    gorvarans (<em>sic</em>), picotes (<em>sic</em>), and others
                    cloths of all colours, some finer and better than
                    others.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>

                  Elite households in the Americas utilized imported Asian silks
                  for domestic furnishing textiles as well as for personal
                  clothing.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>
                  But the Catholic Church was also a voracious consumer of
                  imported Asian textiles for liturgical vestments and altar
                  coverings. The earliest documented use of Chinese textiles for
                  religious purposes in the Iberian world is in the 1521
                  inventory for King Manuel I of Portugal, who owned a vestment
                  made of Chinese brocaded silk.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>
                  Archival records from the late sixteenth and seventeenth
                  centuries document numerous examples of vestments constructed
                  of Chinese silk and intended for churches in the viceroyalties
                  and throughout Spain and Portugal. Pedro Martínez Buytrón, a
                  priest who died in Mexico City in 1596, had a large collection
                  of Chinese export silk vestments in his possession. Buytrón’s
                  estate inventory included a set of purple taffeta garments
                  with a chasuble, a stole, and a maniple. Buytrón also owned a
                  second set of vestments made of black damask silk with yellow
                  damask borders (chasuble, stole, and maniple) as well as two
                  blue and white taffeta silk hangings lined with blue linen and
                  with green and red fringes.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Priests in the viceroyalties seemed to have been early
                  adopters of vestments made from Chinese silk, but the fashion
                  extended to Spain. In 1616, <em>don</em> Diego Vásquez de
                  Mercado, archbishop of Manila, sent his nephew don Pedro de
                  Mercado Vásquez, a <em>regidor</em> (alderman) of Madrid, a
                  set of Chinese silk church vestments that included dalmatics,
                  a chasuble, and a stole.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup>
                  Smaller Spanish villages also frequently received gifts from
                  Asia as tribute or bequests from locals who had emigrated to
                  the viceroyalties. Javier Pescador’s microhistory of a Basque
                  region in northern Spain outlines the sustained donations of
                  Asian goods from expatriates throughout the seventeenth and
                  eighteenth centuries to small parishes (and family members) in
                  the region.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The earliest documented and surviving set of Chinese export
                  silk vestments is preserved in Portugal. The set was ordered
                  in Macau in 1634 by a “very rich and honored Chinese mandarin
                  esteemed for his virtue,” named Francisco Carvalho Aranha, and
                  sent to the brotherhood of Bom Jesus de São Marcos at the
                  church of Santa Cruz (Braga).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref-anchor">13</a></sup>
                  The set included two chasubles, two dalmatics, and a cope (a
                  priest’s wide cape) as well as three altar frontals, a cross
                  cover, a pulpit fall, and a baldachin. Each of the components
                  in the set, made of cream satin silk and crimson velvet silk,
                  was elaborately embroidered with gold and silver thread in a
                  stylized pattern of intertwining vines. Some of the components
                  also incorporate the symbol of the brotherhood. Likely guided
                  by the patron, the tailors and embroiderers who assembled the
                  set in China worked with a clear understanding of the desired
                  forms and ornamentation of these European-style religious
                  textiles.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Unlike Aranha’s fully assembled gift to the brotherhood of Bom
                  Jesus, the set on which this study is based was assembled in
                  Spain using a bolt of imported Chinese silk.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup>
                  Antonio de Morga’s description of “brocades of gold and silver
                  upon silk of various colours and patterns” best describes this
                  long and sumptuous bolt. Woven in China in the late sixteenth
                  or early seventeenth century, this textile has a complicated
                  weave structure and would have been an exceptionally expensive
                  silk when first commissioned and produced.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup>

                  All woven textiles are composed of warp and weft threads. Warp
                  threads run vertically and are the fixed threads that attach
                  to a loom during weaving. Weft threads cross over and under
                  the warps in different configurations to create a woven
                  textile. Compound textiles such as this example are created on
                  large and complex drawlooms with multiple shafts manipulated
                  by the weavers. Composed of a crimson red silk satin warp with
                  wefts in blue, green, and white silk, the weaver has augmented
                  the design with discontinuous supplementary gilded paper wefts
                  brocaded into the textile (fig. 3). Unlike the woven elements
                  of the design, the black eyes of the lions dispersed
                  throughout the design are painted onto the textile.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The creators of this Chinese brocaded silk wove a pattern with
                  a 28½ inch repeat that features a pair of guardian or rampant
                  lions among scrolling foliage and surmounted by a European
                  crown. This striking combination of motifs is derived from
                  Chinese domestic textiles and European—likely Spanish or
                  Italian—silks imported into China. The guardian lions that
                  dominate the design bear a close resemblance to those found on
                  textiles made for Chinese officials, such as a tapestry woven
                  rank badge from the fifteenth century (fig. 4).

                  As early as the fourteenth century, Chinese imperial decrees
                  outlined sumptuary laws for officials of various ranks. To
                  identify their rank, Chinese civil and military officials wore
                  woven or embroidered badges on the front and back of their
                  robes. Within the elaborate hierarchies of power in late Ming
                  imperial China, there were more than twenty different kinds of
                  badges decorated with animals to identify an official’s rank.
                  First and second rank military officials typically wore a
                  badge ornamented with a lion.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup>
                  The lions in both the rank badge and the bolt of cloth feature
                  wide eyes, open toothy grins, and bushy green tails typical of
                  those found on Chinese textiles from the late Ming dynasty.
                  While the rank badge features only one lion, the silk bolt
                  features pairs of guardian lions chasing a brocaded ball, a
                  familiar motif in Chinese iconography that was often regarded
                  as a symbol of happiness (fig. 5).

                  The charming creatures on the silk bolt are not an exclusively
                  Chinese element—they also recall rampant lions, a symbol of
                  nobility in European heraldry. The Chinese weavers may have
                  used Spanish and Italian lampas silks imported to China in the
                  sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as design sources for
                  these rampant lions. A fifteenth-century Spanish lampas silk
                  features a pair of crowned and confronting lions in the midst
                  of scrolling foliage (fig. 6). The undulating plant forms and
                  whimsical animals within this design relate to earlier
                  textiles produced in Spain under the Nasrid dynasty, who ruled
                  the Iberian Peninsula prior to the Christian conquest in 1492.
                  Fragments of silk in this design are preserved in multiple
                  public collections, including at least one that was formerly
                  part of a chasuble.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup>
                  The design of a late-sixteenth- or early-seventeenth-century
                  Italian or Spanish silk bears an even closer relationship to
                  the Chinese silk bolt (fig. 7).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18" class="footnote-ref-anchor">18</a></sup>
                  These fragments are examples of the kinds of European textiles
                  that could have been sent to China to serve as design sources
                  for the Chinese weavers.

                  The Chinese silk’s design repeat also includes a large and
                  distinctly European crown floating above the heads of the
                  guardian lions. The pointed crown, primarily composed of
                  gilded paper, has a brim with a crosshatched pattern in green,
                  blue, and gold and is augmented with two round green jewels
                  encircled in blue. The scrolling vines undulating throughout
                  the background are interspersed with three different types of
                  flowers—one type is likely a chrysanthemum, a motif found
                  frequently on Chinese damask silks made for the domestic
                  market (fig. 8).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19" class="footnote-ref-anchor">19</a></sup>
                  All of these textile designs highlight how weavers in multiple
                  locations around the globe were part of a robust international
                  exchange of design motifs that spanned centuries.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup>

                <p>
                  The combination of Asian and European motifs incorporated into
                  the pattern for the PEM silk helps identify it as Chinese, but
                  there are other distinguishing features that support a Chinese
                  attribution. One of the most reliable ways to identify a
                  Chinese textile—particularly a simple weave without a design
                  or further embellishment—is the width of the textile.
                  Selvage-to-selvage widths of Chinese silks are typically much
                  wider than their European counterparts (26 to 31 inches wide
                  vs. 19½ to 23 inches wide).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21" class="footnote-ref-anchor">21</a></sup>
                  Many Chinese silks also have selvages woven in a contrasting
                  color. Yet another distinguishing feature of many Chinese
                  silks is the presence of sequential holes in the selvages.
                  These holes are evidence of a pair of crossed rods—sometimes
                  called temple rods—used by weavers to help maintain a
                  symmetrical fabric width during weaving. Chinese silks also
                  have a soft, clinging “hand” that is the result of mechanical
                  calendering.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22" class="footnote-ref-anchor">22</a></sup>
                  The selvage-to-selvage width of the bolt of silk used to
                  create PEM’s set of vestments is approximately 28 inches. The
                  selvage edges—only visible now on the surviving unlined silk
                  fragment—are white. Also visible on the fragment, just inside
                  the selvage edge, is a thin continuous line of yellow satin
                  weave silk. Occasionally visible at the seams of different
                  components of the set, these yellow silk lines presumably
                  framed the edges of the fabric and would have aided tailors in
                  matching up seams.

                  Early Chinese silks incorporating European motifs have
                  traditionally been attributed to weavers in Macau. This is
                  likely based on the assumption that the weavers would have
                  needed direct contact with foreign agents to produce textiles
                  incorporating European motifs, but there is limited evidence
                  that Macau was an early center for silk weaving in China.
                  Export ceramic production in the sixteenth and seventeenth
                  centuries can serve as a useful model for speculating on other
                  plausible locations for the production of these early export
                  silks. Potters in Jingdezhen during the late Ming dynasty
                  successfully produced and exported customized ceramics
                  incorporating global motifs despite being more than three
                  hundred miles from the Chinese coastline. Using this
                  customized porcelain production as a model, could these early
                  export silks have been woven in one of a variety of silk
                  production centers in southern China? Suzhou and Hangzhou
                  produced high-quality silk for imperial and regional use
                  during the late Ming dynasty, and Guangdong and Fujian
                  provinces were also major silk production centers. Given that
                  Hokkien merchants controlled the early Chinese junk trade from
                  Fujian to Manila, perhaps the coastal cities of Fuzhou and
                  Quanzhou could be plausible production centers for the complex
                  silks exported to the Philippines during the sixteenth and
                  seventeenth centuries. Quanzhou, in particular, was known
                  during the Ming dynasty for pattern weave silks and silks
                  incorporating gold and silk thread.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn23" id="fnref23" class="footnote-ref-anchor">23</a></sup>
                  We can perhaps begin to test this assumption by conducting
                  analysis of dyestuffs and other materials used in these
                  textiles and reviewing their weave structures.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Xian Zhang from History Echoes Analytical Services is an
                  analytical chemist with experience in natural dyestuffs, who
                  studied several samples from the unlined fragment in PEM’s
                  set. Her testing provides analytical information on the silk
                  and reinforces the assertion that the textile was made in
                  China. The crimson red silk that dominates the textile was
                  dyed with lac, a traditional dye source used throughout Asia
                  that is derived from the lac insect.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn24" id="fnref24" class="footnote-ref-anchor">24</a></sup>
                  The green silk used for the bushy tails of the lions and as a
                  border for some of the motifs was dyed with indigo (blue) and
                  pagoda tree buds (yellow). Pagoda trees (<em>Styphnolobium japonicum</em>) are native to central and northern China and Korea. The
                  gilded strips selectively added throughout the textile are
                  composed of a thin sheet of gold foil attached with a mixture
                  of animal glue, kaolin clay, and laterite to a compound paper
                  substrate. The foil layer is composed of 70 percent gold, 17
                  percent silver, and other minor elements, an alloy that is
                  consistent with Chinese gold foil samples found on ancient
                  textiles.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn25" id="fnref25" class="footnote-ref-anchor">25</a></sup>
                  Despite what Antonio de Morga wrote about these kinds of
                  textiles in 1609, not “all the spangles of gold and silver are
                  <strong>false</strong> and upon paper.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn26" id="fnref26" class="footnote-ref-anchor">26</a></sup>

                  Weavers have been incorporating paper covered in gold foil
                  into Chinese textiles for more than two thousand years.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn27" id="fnref27" class="footnote-ref-anchor">27</a></sup>
                  An English visitor to Hong Kong in the 1870s watched gold foil
                  being produced while touring an alley near the street for silk
                  embroiderers. He noted:

                  Once woven, this sumptuous bolt of lightweight, supple, and
                  vibrantly colored silk would have been carefully packed and
                  shipped from southern China to Manila. Beginning in the 1570s,
                  Hokkien merchants from Fujian dominated the Chinese junk trade
                  in Southeast and East Asia. Junks traveled from ports along
                  the Fujian coastline—Quanzhou and Xiamen—as well as from
                  Guangzhou and Macao—on vessels that typically weighed 350 tons
                  and carried a crew of between two and four hundred men. Some
                  of the largest had crews of close to five hundred.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn29" id="fnref29" class="footnote-ref-anchor">29</a></sup>
                  The journey from China to Manila typically took between
                  fifteen and twenty days.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1589, eighty-eight Chinese junks were licensed for
                  international maritime trade. By 1597, the licensed junks had
                  increased to 137. Roughly half of those Chinese vessels were
                  engaged with direct trade between Fujian and Manila.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn30" id="fnref30" class="footnote-ref-anchor">30</a></sup>
                  Smuggling was rampant, so it is difficult to pinpoint the
                  precise numbers of junks trading with the Philippines, but it
                  is estimated that between twenty and forty junks visited
                  Manila annually between the late 1570s and the early 1640s.
                  Silk made up the bulk of their cargoes, which the Hokkien
                  merchants sold for as much South American silver as they could
                  acquire, annually sending as much as 150 tons of silver back
                  to China. Jerónimo de Salazar y Salcedo reported to the king
                  in 1599 that the profits to be made on imported Chinese silk
                  were as high as 400 percent.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn31" id="fnref31" class="footnote-ref-anchor">31</a></sup>

                  Hokkien merchants also resided long-term in Manila and ran the
                  hundreds of retail shops in the Parián market just outside the
                  walls of the city. But unlike the many Chinese silks offered
                  in the market, this sumptuous bolt was likely a special
                  commission and would not have been offered for retail sale.
                  Chinese textile merchants were particularly skilled at folding
                  and rolling textiles to the specifications of buyers to
                  maximize the quantities of silk that could be packed. Once
                  loaded into the hold of a galleon for the long journey across
                  the Pacific Ocean from Manila to Acapulco, this special
                  commission would have been transshipped across Mexico to
                  Veracruz for reshipment and delivery in Seville. This bolt was
                  likely commissioned for a high-ranking priest—either as a
                  special commission he made for himself or as a gift from a
                  colleague or family member. When a canon was appointed and
                  received his prebend—the portion of the cathedral’s revenue
                  allotted to a senior member of the church—it was typical for
                  him to order a new set of vestments. At the cathedral in
                  Huesca, Spain, for example, it was required that a newly
                  appointed bishop present a chasuble, tunic, tunicle, two
                  dalmatics, and three copes to the cathedral within three years
                  of his appointment. These vestments often reverted to a
                  cathedral’s collection upon a bishop’s death, a practice that
                  accounts for the diversity of splendid textiles preserved
                  within Spanish church treasuries to this day.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn32" id="fnref32" class="footnote-ref-anchor">32</a></sup>

                  The Spanish tailors who created this set of vestments lavishly
                  used the imported silk bolt on the most significant and
                  visible components of the set—the underside of the baldachin
                  and the backs of the dalmatics and chasuble. But they also
                  ensured the maximum use of this precious textile by thriftily
                  piecing together small fragments of the silk to create the
                  maniples and stole. The tailors also incorporated locally made
                  textiles for both decorative and functional purposes when
                  stitching the components together. Each piece is decoratively
                  augmented with Spanish tape woven in red, white, and blue
                  cotton (fig. 9). European tailors typically used this type of
                  tape to reinforce and cover the seams of the narrow widths of
                  European silks used on many church vestments. Given the wider
                  width of Chinese silk, the tape on the PEM vestments is used
                  more decoratively, often stitched on top of a single length of
                  silk, rather than necessarily covering a seam.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn33" id="fnref33" class="footnote-ref-anchor">33</a></sup>
                  Various elements of the set were also lined with European
                  linen to provide support for the especially thin and supple
                  Chinese silk.

                  The baldachin is perhaps the most unusual component of the set
                  to survive (fig 10). Baldachins are architectural canopies
                  that mark and enclose a space in a religious, civic, or
                  domestic environment. As noted in Rivas’s essay in this
                  volume, textile canopies were sometimes hung above a throne or
                  chair in the palaces and homes of the elite. The 1729
                  inventory of Carlos Bermúdez de Castro, archbishop of Manila,
                  included a baldachin, which he used to display artworks.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn34" id="fnref34" class="footnote-ref-anchor">34</a></sup>
                  Baldachins used religiously typically hang above an altar or
                  devotional image, suspended from above or supported on slender
                  columns. Encountered on its own, this baldachin could have
                  been made for either a domestic or religious setting, but its
                  survival with accompanying religious garments made from the
                  same Chinese silk indicates that it was likely designed to be
                  used religiously.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Textile panels hang from the front and sides of the canopy,
                  but not the back, indicating that the baldachin was likely
                  suspended over an altarpiece against a wall.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn35" id="fnref35" class="footnote-ref-anchor">35</a></sup>
                  Iron rings stitched to the front corners of the baldachin once
                  accommodated chains to suspend the canopy from the ceiling.
                  Chinese silk fully lines the underside of the canopy roof so
                  that during prayer or a service, a viewer gazed up at the
                  glittering lengths of the silk’s beautiful design. The
                  baldachin’s sixty-inch depth is greater than two widths of the
                  Chinese silk, so the tailors carefully stitched a narrow
                  length of the same silk between the two full widths that run
                  from proper left to right underneath the canopy.

                  The narrow panels that hang from the canopy also feature
                  sections of silk on the exterior, but the tailors economized
                  by using a Chinese plain weave blue silk on the inside of the
                  hanging panels. When the Peabody Essex Museum acquired the
                  set, this blue silk lining survived only as fragmentary
                  evidence, revealing that the tailors had sandwiched a
                  stabilizing linen lining between the brocaded and blue silks
                  for greater structure (fig. 11). When the canopy was
                  originally in use, the lining would never have been visible.
                  An inscription in ink preserved on the lining—“48 de M<sup>a</sup>
                  Fr<sup>s</sup> en el pasatienpo”—offers an enigmatic but
                  tantalizing clue to the set’s provenance (fig. 12). The “48”
                  is possibly an inventory number for the church’s collection of
                  vestments. Since M<sup>a</sup> is typically shorthand for
                  Maria, and Fr<sup>s</sup> could be an abbreviation for
                  Francisca, could this inscription document the participation
                  of a female donor or seamstress in the creation of the
                  set?<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn36" id="fnref36" class="footnote-ref-anchor">36</a></sup>

                  The linen lining has an additional secret. While the front and
                  proper right side panels were lined with lengths of plain
                  linen, the tailors frugally recycled two different kinds of
                  European block printed linen to line the proper left side
                  panel (figs. 13 and 14).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn37" id="fnref37" class="footnote-ref-anchor">37</a></sup>
                  Printed with a mordant dye using madder root, the simple
                  designs on these recycled panels were inspired by more
                  sophisticated imported Indian cottons (fig. 15).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn38" id="fnref38" class="footnote-ref-anchor">38</a></sup>
                  Hiding in plain sight, these humble (and now rare) European
                  linen fragments are another tangible link to the global
                  network of exchange in textiles during this period.

                  Sets of vestments all made from the same fabric created a
                  cohesive ensemble for feast days. The deep crimson red of the
                  silk used for this set of vestments may indicate that it was
                  used for a specific feast day or perhaps even during Holy
                  Week, leading up to the celebration of Easter. The satin weave
                  of the silk and the gilded paper floats would have undoubtedly
                  sparkled brilliantly by candlelight during Mass.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn39" id="fnref39" class="footnote-ref-anchor">39</a></sup>
                  Preserved as a set for over four centuries, this rare group of
                  liturgical textiles is a tangible link to the early global
                  network of exchange between China, the Philippines, Mexico,
                  and Spain and the power and wealth of the Catholic Church in
                  this period.

                        The discipline of microhistory, first developed in the
                        1970s by Italian historians working with a cache of
                        Catholic Church documents, is “based on the reduction of
                        the scale of observation, on a microscopic analysis, and
                        on intensive study of the documentary material.”

                        See Rivas’s essay in this volume for details on some
                        domestic consumption. Chinese silks dominated the market
                        in the viceroyalties, but elites also combined
                        Castilian, Italian, and even locally produced silks into
                        their households and wardrobes. For more on those

                        A related set of vestments, now dispersed, was made from
                        a similarly long bolt of Chinese export silk with gilt
                        paper floats woven between the 1580s and the 1640s. That
                        silk bolt’s design incorporates Augustinian or Habsburg
                        double-headed eagle motifs rendered in blue, yellow, and
                        white silk on a red satin ground. Textile fragments from
                        this large set survive in multiple public collections.

                        (973.422), the Rijksmuseum for a fragment of a chasuble

                        line the other sides and the top of the canopy were
                        likely new when the baldachin was first assembled.
