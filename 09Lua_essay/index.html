    <title>Cut from the World | Transpacific Crossings</title>

    <meta name="description" content="For 250 years (1565–1815), the Manila Galleon transported Asian goods from the Philippines to the Americas under the rule of the Spanish Crown. Stopping in Acapulco, Mexico, the silk, fans, lacquered goods, clothes, and porcelain brought by the galleon rapidly circulated through the Americas, introducing a new visual culture that influenced objects, consumers, makers, and merchants alike. Conversely, products imported from the Americas, such as silver, indigo dye, cochineal red, chili peppers, and corn, had an enormous impact on Asia. Eleven scholars from the United States, Mexico, and Singapore present current research on how the vast exchange of materials, techniques, and ideas between continents impacted the trajectory of art and material culture across the Pacific.">

                  In 1830, Captain Joseph Jenkins Knapp Jr. (1803–1830) donated
                  a square piece of Philippine <em>piña</em> cloth to the East
                  India Marine Society Museum, one of the originating
                  collections of the current Peabody Essex Museum in Salem,
                  Massachusetts (fig. 1).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                  Piña cloth is fabric woven out of the finest fibers of
                  pineapple leaves, creating a soft, sheer, and fine material
                  like that of a cotton muslin. A description written directly
                  on this fabric makes note of this material knowledge and
                  leaves a trace of the cloth’s collection history. Though now
                  significantly faded, it reads: “4182 / Made of the fibers of
                  the Pine Apple at Manilla [sic] by the natives” (fig. 2).
                  Rather than an imported good brought back for consumers in the
                  United States, this cloth was categorized under what the
                  Society bylaws termed “articles of curiosity.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                  This language was specific to the Society’s mission to build a
                  scientific collection, in which it charged captains and
                  supercargoes to bring back objects from their travels overseas
                  for the Society’s museum. Applied here, the cloth was
                  designated for building scientific knowledge through early
                  museum practice in the US.

                  Compared to other objects acquired by the East India Marine
                  Society Museum, Knapp’s piña cloth was unusual. Some merchants
                  at the time did not know the original use and function of the
                  items that they collected. For them and for the viewers who
                  would later see these items on display, the various objects
                  were merely viewed as representations of their respective
                  cultures or of the exchanges that had taken place
                  overseas.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                  However, Captain J. J. Knapp was knowledgeable about his
                  cloth, particularly when it came to the fabric’s composition.
                  While seemingly a minute detail—especially given the
                  ghost-like remnants of the cloth’s description—Knapp’s correct
                  identification of the fabric’s pineapple leaf material is rare
                  and exceptional. Due to its material similarity to silk, fine
                  cotton, and linen, piña has often eluded consumers and museum
                  practitioners both then and now.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                  Furthermore, while some items in the museum’s founding
                  collection were removed from their original ritual or
                  spiritual environments, because piña did not have a ceremonial
                  function in the Philippines, Knapp’s cloth did not lose any
                  sort of sacred meaning through its acquisition. For the
                  purposes of building the growing collection at the East India
                  Marine Society Museum, Knapp’s knowledge of the cloth was
                  accurate and sufficient.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, as a small piece of cloth now in the United States,
                  Knapp’s piña was cut from a larger physical and cultural
                  fabric that was left unwritten in Knapp’s description, one
                  that wove together the fabric’s craft and sartorial
                  significance in the Philippines. In the archipelago, the cloth
                  would have moved between the hands of makers and consumers
                  across multiple islands. The first step of production took
                  place on the island of Panay, where artisans worked to
                  extract, process, hand-knot, and weave pineapple leaf fibers.
                  The woven fabric would then travel north to Manila, the
                  present-day capital of the Philippines, and its surrounding
                  regions, where <em>bordadoras</em> (embroiderers) and
                  <em>costureras</em> (seamstresses) decorated and fashioned the
                  cloth into outfits such as the men’s
                  <em>barong tagalog</em> and women’s <em>baro’t saya</em>. As
                  one of the finest fabrics used in these traditional garments,
                  piña clothed the elite echelons of Manila society. The
                  fabric’s translucence and intricate embroidery came to
                  symbolize wealth and a cosmopolitanism that was affordable to
                  only a few. Cut from this cultural fabric, Knapp’s cloth
                  captured both this interisland manufacture as well as the
                  material’s meaning within Philippine fashion.

                  Reading Knapp’s description and beyond it, this essay unpacks
                  not only the dynamic world of Philippine piña craft and
                  fashion but also the fabric’s inclusion within the founding
                  collection of the East Indian Marine Society Museum. As a
                  textile fragment, the cloth’s very pineapple leaf material
                  remains as an archive of its weaving methods and sartorial
                  culture in the Philippines during the early nineteenth
                  century. At the same time, the fragment is evidence of its
                  significance as an object for scientific inquiry within the
                  East India Marine Society Museum collection, a project that
                  simultaneously projected a global citizenship for a young
                  nation like the United States. Having arrived in the US a
                  decade after the last galleon sailed the Manila–Acapulco
                  trade, this example of piña at the present-day Peabody Essex
                  Museum highlights a new facet of these transpacific crossings.
                  While the Manila Galleon trade might have ended, transpacific
                  exchange continued in new ways with new actors. For Salem,
                  this exchange contributed to a cross-cultural intersection
                  where art, trade, and scientific exploration contributed to
                  early American museum practice at the East Indian Marine
                  Society Museum.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>

                  <strong>Nineteenth-Century Philippine Piña Craft and
                    Fashion</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Though now a plain-woven, square-cut piece of cloth, Knapp’s
                  piña fabric had once lived in the vibrant world of piña craft
                  and fashion in the Philippines. Far from the static display at
                  the East India Marine Society Museum, Knapp’s cloth embodies a
                  larger and more dynamic context within the textile tradition
                  and cosmopolitan culture of the Philippines during the
                  nineteenth century.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Yet, this dynamic context of piña fabric begins not in the
                  Philippines but in South America. Before discussing piña craft
                  and fashion, it is important to note that the pineapple plant
                  itself is not native to the Philippines. The exact origin
                  story of how the pineapple arrived in the Philippines is
                  shrouded in myth, but most scholars believe that Ferdinand
                  Magellan’s voyages brought the fruit from South America and
                  introduced it to Philippine soil shortly after landing in the
                  Visayan region in 1521.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>
                  As pineapples proliferated in he tropical Philippine
                  landscape, weavers adapted the techniques of creating native
                  banana leaf fabric, or <em>abaca</em>, to producing woven
                  cloth with this new pineapple leaf material. In particular,
                  makers used the method of hand-knotting abaca fibers to make
                  thread for producing piña thread as well.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>
                  By the early nineteenth century, Spanish friar and botanist
                  Manuel Blanco noted this weaving tradition in his botanical
                  text <em>Flora de Filipinas</em> (1837), which is still
                  considered a foundational treatise for Philippine botany. In
                  his entry on the <em>Bromelia ananas</em> species, he recorded
                  that the Native <em>indios</em> made shirts of remarkable
                  delicacy with the fine threads drawn from pineapple
                  leaves.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>
                  Measuring the visual impact of the transpacific crossing of
                  piña requires considering first the transpacific crossing of
                  the pineapple. Even for a cloth closely associated with
                  Filipino culture, Knapp’s fabric must be understood as a
                  product of not just one transpacific crossing but two: the
                  first from South America to the Philippines and the second
                  from the Philippines to the United States.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although Knapp had written “Manilla” on his fabric, piña
                  production took place and continues to take place on Panay
                  Island, located south of Manila on the western side of the
                  Visayan region. When weavers created Knapp’s cloth during the
                  nineteenth century, centers for piña manufacture existed in
                  Iloilo, a province located in southeast Panay.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>
                  Today, piña is largely woven in the northern portion of the
                  island in the province of Aklan, where the technique remains a
                  cottage industry traditionally practiced by women. While there
                  have been a few technological changes in tools involved in the
                  craft, much of scholars’ and contemporary weavers’ knowledge
                  of historic processes draws from present-day practices.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The first step in producing Knapp’s piña cloth was harvesting
                  pineapple leaves, which makers then scraped to extract the
                  leaf fiber for the fabric’s thread. The specific pineapple
                  variety used for piña is the Red Spanish pineapple. According
                  to weavers, this pineapple yields stronger fibers than other
                  varieties. The leaves that the artisans harvested came not
                  from the crown of the pineapple but from the bush where the
                  fruit grows. Each leaf measures around a meter long. Once
                  makers gathered the amount of leaves that they planned to
                  scrape for the day, two rounds of leaf scraping ensued to
                  extract two kinds of piña fiber. First, using a sanded-down
                  porcelain plate shard, the leaf-scraper would begin to scrape
                  the epidermis of the pineapple leaf (fig. 3).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup>
                  The scraper would remove just enough to reveal the first layer
                  of piña fibers, called the washed-out fiber. The maker would
                  extract these fibers by pulling them up and off the leaf by
                  hand.

                  For the second round, the scraper would take a coconut
                  shell—also sanded down—and begin scraping the leaf where she
                  had just extracted the washed-out fiber (fig. 4). Once the
                  leaf was thin enough, the maker would pull the second fiber
                  from the back of the leaf, also by hand. This fiber, called
                  <em>liniwan</em>, was the finer of the two. Today, piña
                  textiles are often made with both the coarser washed-out fiber
                  and the liniwan fiber. However, during the nineteenth century,
                  all piña textiles were made only with the finer liniwan
                  fiber.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup>
                  Knapp’s piña cloth was most likely woven with liniwan fiber,
                  which is evident in the delicate and translucent materiality
                  of its fabric.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After extracting and cleaning the piña fibers, artisans made
                  piña thread by tying each individual fiber from end to end,
                  resulting in one continuous filament (fig. 5). As previously
                  discussed, piña weavers adapted this technique of
                  hand-knotting fibers from making banana-leaf threads, which
                  were also created by the tying of individual fibers together.
                  Hand-knotting was not limited to preparing piña thread,
                  however. Due to the delicate nature of the fiber, threads
                  often broke as weavers began to prepare the warp or began to
                  weave on the loom. To fix these breakages, the weaver would go
                  back to the broken threads and reconnect the fibers by tying
                  them together. Piña fabrics like Knapp’s cloth display this
                  process of hand-knotting and rehand-knotting. Under
                  magnification, small knots appear throughout the piña fabric,
                  bearing witness to the unique quality of piña thread and the
                  hand-knotting technique necessary to accommodate the fine
                  material (fig. 6). As one can imagine, the process of
                  hand-knotting fibers, both to make and to fix threads,
                  requires great patience and a meticulous hand.

                  Once hand-knotters finished creating piña thread, they
                  supplied it to local weavers. Like most weaving traditions,
                  weaving piña began with preparing the warp threads and weft
                  threads. Preparing piña warp meant calculating the length of
                  warp thread that the weaver needed for the desired length and
                  width of the intended fabric. To calculate these measurements,
                  the artisan would wind the hand-knotted piña thread around a
                  cylindrical warp frame, whose wooden spokes marked different
                  points of measurement to help the weaver keep count of the
                  amount of warp threads she had wound (fig. 7). Preparing piña
                  weft required a different process. Taking the hand-knotted
                  piña, the weaver would use a spindle to wind thread around a
                  bobbin. Afterward, she placed the bobbin into a shuttle, which
                  she would then use for weaving (fig. 8). Once the weaver
                  calculated the warp and dressed the floor loom, she began to
                  weave (fig. 9). Most piña fabrics display a plain-weave
                  structure or variations of a plain-weave structure
                  thereof.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref-anchor">13</a></sup>
                  Knapp’s cloth, for instance, displays a plain-weave structure,
                  where one weft thread is woven over one warp thread, resulting
                  in a soft and diaphanous fabric.

                  The woven piña cloth could go to several textile distribution
                  points after its completion. Within the island of Panay,
                  vendors could sell piña along with other textiles at local,
                  open-air marketplaces. Here, vendors ranged from the local
                  weaver who sold her own products to the entrepreneurial
                  <em>sinamayera</em>, or textile vendor, who sold the products
                  of several weavers and embroiderers. Leaving Panay, ships from
                  Manila transported these woven fabrics from the port of Iloilo
                  back to the capital, where sinamayeras in different districts
                  sold the piña cloth. These markets in Manila often drew in
                  textiles from a variety of provinces, where piña was sold
                  alongside textiles from northern provinces like those in the
                  Ilocos region. Furthermore, as it had been during the height
                  of the Manila–Acapulco trade, Manila remained as the
                  archipelago’s main <em>entrepôt</em> through which foreign
                  merchants could access the Philippine market. Rather than
                  describing where the cloth was woven, then, Knapp’s
                  description of “Manilla” points to the location where he, and
                  most foreign consumers, acquired finished piña fabric.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Knapp had collected his textile as an undecorated fabric, but
                  had the cloth remained in the Philippines, a textile vendor
                  could have taken the full piña yardage to a nearby bordadora
                  for further embellishment. In the hands of the bordadora,
                  plain piña fabric became a canvas for elegant florals, vines,
                  and geometric patterns (fig. 10). Similar to piña weaving,
                  many of the needlework techniques have remained in use since
                  the nineteenth century.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup>
                  During the nineteenth century, these historic embroidery
                  centers were located in various Manila neighborhoods, such as
                  Ermita, Malate, Santa Ana, Tondo, and Paco.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup>
                  First, the bordadora would directly embroider on the cloth.
                  This technique allowed her to create the beautiful,
                  free-flowing designs typically seen on piña. The next step was
                  <em>bakbak</em>, or drawn threadwork, in which the bordadora
                  pulled threads from the woven cloth to open the plain weave
                  structure. The result is a gridlike fabric. Lastly, the
                  bordadora would embroider other designs in these open spaces
                  with a technique called <em>calado</em>, or open threadwork.
                  Here, the bordadora would be able to return to decorating with
                  organic lines and forms, and these designs are often in
                  repeating patterns as dictated by the grid drawn by the bakbak
                  of the previous step. Although Knapp’s cloth did not feature
                  any of these embroidered designs, piña fabrics operated within
                  an ecosystem of craft that connected weaving and needlework
                  across multiple islands.

                <p>
                  After the cloth was embroidered—or if costumers wanted to keep
                  their fabric undecorated—consumers would have purchased the
                  original yardage and hired a costurera to make clothing.
                  During the nineteenth century, the sartorial culture of the
                  lowland Philippine region was such that the value of a garment
                  was attributed to the material of the clothing rather than the
                  silhouette. Due to the great labor involved in weaving piña,
                  very few could afford to buy the fabric, and piña garments
                  were usually reserved only for special occasions. As a result,
                  piña mostly clothed the elite men and women of Manila,
                  conveying a sense of <em>urbanidad</em>, or an attitude of
                  fashionable, urban refinement.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  For women’s fashion, this economic hierarchy of material was
                  especially apparent as the outfits for women were the same
                  across every socioeconomic class. During the nineteenth
                  century, Filipino women wore the baro’t saya, which consisted
                  of a loose, cropped blouse, called the <em>baro</em>, and a
                  <em>saya</em>, or skirt. Sometimes, women could wear a
                  <em>pañuelo</em> (shawl) over their baro and a
                  <em>tapis</em> (overskirt) that would be wrapped around their
                  saya. The saya and tapis were usually made with thick, dark
                  material, but the baro could range in materials from abaca and
                  cotton to <em>jusi</em> and piña. Nevertheless, while the
                  outfits’ basic silhouettes were the same, the baro that was
                  woven with piña was more expensive, which made it more
                  luxurious than the baro woven with other materials. In the
                  watercolor <em>tipos del pais</em>, or “country types,”
                  paintings created by Damián Domingo (1796–1834), this shift is
                  evident in the blue, opaque fabric of the
                  <em>India Ollera de Pasig</em>’s baro versus the embroidered,
                  translucent baro, pañuelo, and head covering of the
                  <em>Mistisa de Manila</em> (figs. 11 and 12).

                  Men’s fashion featured a greater variety of silhouettes and
                  therefore depended less on this hierarchy of material to
                  signify the socioeconomic status of the wearer. Among these
                  outfits was the <em>barong mahaba</em>, a long, collared shirt
                  that men wore untucked (fig. 13). Most men on a day-to-day
                  basis, however, wore more simple silhouettes, such as the man
                  featured in Domingo’s <em>Indio de Yloco</em> (fig. 14). Set
                  against this Philippine cultural context, Knapp’s fragment
                  physically and figuratively represents only a piece of this
                  textile and fashion tradition, one whose cultural meaning
                  pulled from botanical history, craft knowledge, and sartorial
                  value.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18" class="footnote-ref-anchor">18</a></sup>

                  However, Knapp’s cloth did not make it into the barong mahaba
                  or baro’t saya of a Manila man or woman. Cut from its larger
                  fabric, Knapp’s cloth instead traveled from the Philippines to
                  Salem during a moment of economic transition. After the
                  British invaded Manila in the 1760s, Spanish economic control
                  over the Philippine colony weakened, resulting in the gradual
                  cessation of the Manila Galleon trade beginning in 1810 until
                  its last trip in 1815. Trade soon began to open to other
                  foreign merchants outside of Spain, like merchants from the
                  United States.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19" class="footnote-ref-anchor">19</a></sup>
                  Within the Philippines, beginning in 1778, General-Governor
                  José de Basco y Vargas looked to domestic agriculture to
                  supply cash crops for export as he foresaw the end to an
                  economy dependent on the Manila Galleon. This plan for
                  agricultural development coincided with an upsurge in local
                  textile production, which utilized the new crops resulting
                  from the general-governor’s program.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup>
                  Knapp’s arrival to the Philippines and acquisition of piña was
                  a point of convergence in the archipelago’s history. The
                  captain had set foot in Manila not only as its ports opened to
                  merchants like him but also during a time when textiles like
                  his piña cloth were the country’s priority for economic
                  development.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As an item categorized under “articles of curiosity,” this
                  object’s classification is distinct from the return cargo that
                  East India Marine Society members brought back as import
                  goods. From the Philippines, Salem merchants brought back
                  indigo, which supplied the growing New England dyeing
                  industry, as well as sugar.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21" class="footnote-ref-anchor">21</a></sup>
                  Abaca, or what was known as Manila hemp, later entered the
                  market as a fiber popularly used for rope.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22" class="footnote-ref-anchor">22</a></sup>
                  In Salem, advertisements for Manila hemp cordage appear in the
                  <em>Salem Gazette</em> into the 1820s.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn23" id="fnref23" class="footnote-ref-anchor">23</a></sup>
                  Although Knapp’s piña cloth traveled on the same return trip
                  as these other products, the fabric, as an article of
                  curiosity, was separate from the items that traveled as import
                  goods.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Instead, Knapp’s piña cloth gives image to a different
                  material culture in the United States during the 1820s. With
                  the rise of early-nineteenth-century museums in New England
                  and the mid-Atlantic, objects of scientific inquiry were
                  collected from overseas trading ventures in addition to the
                  imported goods sold to the public. Born from
                  eighteenth-century European curiosity cabinets that housed
                  natural and ethnographic objects, institutions like the East
                  India Marine Society Museum fostered this spirit of discovery
                  through active collecting practices. In a similar expression
                  as the cabinet of curiosity, the pursuit for global objects
                  during the early nineteenth century was tied to larger
                  formulations of American national character, one that took
                  shape in relation to the young nation’s citizenship in the
                  world. As a port city with two active marine societies, Salem
                  was uniquely positioned to project this identity as American
                  traders went out and foreign goods entered, fortifying the
                  nation’s connection to the seas and lands beyond it.
                  Collecting articles of curiosity like Knapp’s piña thus served
                  a dual purpose of advancing scientific knowledge as an
                  implicit declaration of national standing.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn24" id="fnref24" class="footnote-ref-anchor">24</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  As a museum founded and maintained by its members, the East
                  India Marine Society charged both the mariners and its
                  institution with this mission for scientific advancement,
                  conflating both mariner and institutional knowledge of these
                  objects. The traders who had set out from Salem were the first
                  individuals through which knowledge of these items passed. Not
                  only was this expectation clearly stated in the Society’s
                  bylaws, but the journals that each ship was expected to keep
                  also gave detailed instructions regarding object collection.
                  At the tail end of several paragraphs that instruct the daily
                  recording of wind quality, latitude, longitude, and distance
                  traveled, the directions conclude with criteria for object
                  collection:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    There should be collected for the Museum, specimens of
                    various kinds of vegetable substances, earths, minerals,
                    ores, metals, volcanic substances, &amp;c. There should also
                    be preserved (according to the directions hereafter given)
                    such parts of birds, insects, fish, &amp;c. as serve most
                    easily to distinguish them. . . . Inquiry should be made for
                    any remarkable books in use among any of the eastern
                    nations, with their subjects, dates and titles. Articles of
                    the dress and ornaments of any nation, with the images and
                    objects of religious devotion, should be procured.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn25" id="fnref25" class="footnote-ref-anchor">25</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  For mariners like Captain J. J. Knapp, this commission
                  translated into an experiential knowledge of the objects. As
                  men who had set foot in these distant isles and countries,
                  even if for a moment compared to the months spent at sea, East
                  India Marine Society members collected these materials through
                  a direct experience that most did not have of the lands and
                  societies in which these objects originated. In other words,
                  unlike the many who mistook fabrics like cotton or silk as
                  piña, and vice versa, Knapp knew that his cloth was made from
                  pineapple leaf fibers because he had seen the fabric during
                  his time in Manila and was informed of its material.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, this experiential knowledge must be qualified, as it
                  was not the same as that possessed by those who made and wore
                  piña. For one, though Knapp had physically been in the
                  Philippines, his vocation was not one that allowed him to stay
                  in one place for too long. Unlike the expatriate who resided
                  in a given location for several years, captains and
                  supercargoes spent more time on the ocean than at their
                  destinations.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn26" id="fnref26" class="footnote-ref-anchor">26</a></sup>
                  As a result, his experiential knowledge was limited to what he
                  could learn about piña from local informants during his short
                  stay in one location. Furthermore, it is also possible that
                  Knapp might have learned more than what he shared with the
                  East India Marine Society. The brief record that made it onto
                  the cloth and into the East India Marine Society catalog might
                  be more reflective of cataloging convention rather than
                  Knapp’s complete understanding of the material. Nevertheless,
                  while Knapp might have learned that the fabric was indeed made
                  with pineapple leaf fibers, his knowledge did not extend
                  beyond what he saw and heard during his time in Manila. As a
                  mariner, Knapp received an incomplete knowledge of piña cloth,
                  returning to Salem unaware of where the cloth was woven and
                  the purposes for which it was used.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nevertheless, this partial understanding of piña fulfilled the
                  scientific inquiry requested by the East India Marine Society,
                  and it was this object knowledge that became institutional
                  through Knapp’s donation of the cloth to the museum. In the
                  1831 object catalog, the description written on Knapp’s piña
                  bore more empirical language. Rather than simply “Made of the
                  fibers of the Pine Apple,” as was written on the cloth,
                  Knapp’s piña became a “Specimen of Cloth manufactured from the
                  fibres of the Pine Apple, from Manilla.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn27" id="fnref27" class="footnote-ref-anchor">27</a></sup>
                  While the language of the description alone evokes the
                  scientific meaning that Knapp’s cloth had taken on, its
                  context within the rest of the museum’s collection of
                  Philippine objects emphasizes this transformation. Several
                  other objects from the Philippines were labeled as specimens,
                  such as a volcanic pitchstone and ammonite from Luzon, the
                  northern island region where Manila is located.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn28" id="fnref28" class="footnote-ref-anchor">28</a></sup>
                  Many items were not given the descriptor “specimen,” but they
                  did not deviate too far in nature from objects like the
                  pitchstone and ammonite. Examples include a Muraena fish, iron
                  ore, pearl nautilus cups, and a species of pigeon called
                  <em>Columba cruenta</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn29" id="fnref29" class="footnote-ref-anchor">29</a></sup>
                  There were a few objects that might have been classified as
                  more cultural than natural, such as a pair of women’s
                  slippers, swords, and cigars, so it is possible that Knapp’s
                  cloth may have been understood as examples of both Philippine
                  culture and natural history.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn30" id="fnref30" class="footnote-ref-anchor">30</a></sup>
                  Regardless, by the time of its acquisition, piña’s material
                  was stripped of its associations with early histories of craft
                  and cosmopolitan fashion in the Philippines. In the hands of
                  the institution, piña, in its partial understanding and
                  scientific use, along with the other Philippine objects in the

                        While trade between the Philippines and Salem was

                        1991), 26–27. Montinola’s volume continues to be the
                        authority for most scholarship on the pineapple’s
                        history in the Philippines. Here, she writes of
                        different pathways that the pineapple could have taken
                        in the hands of fifteenth-century Portuguese and Spanish
                        explorers. Elena Phipps cites other sources in her essay
                        on the international trade of silk, cotton, banana
                        fiber, and piña textiles, but these sources also look
                        primarily to Montinola’s volume for the history of the
                        pineapple in the Philippines. With the exception of
                        Antonio Pigafetta’s text from 1521, Montinola’s evidence
                        draws mostly from twentieth-century US sources. A deeper
                        study of the pinapple’s botanical history would enrich
                        future scholarship on piña cloth. Elena Phipps, “Silk,

                        Translucence.” Montinola, for instance, documents the
                        contemporary techniques of weaving piña in her
                        monograph, explaining the endurance of these processes
                        into the twentieth century. In 2022, I was also able to
                        visit these piña weaving communities to learn about the
                        material and their craft. In particular, I thank the
                        weavers of Dela Cruz House of Piña, Raquel’s Piña Cloth
                        Products, and La Herminia for their generosity in time
                        and expertise. I also thank Anna India Dela Cruz
                        Legaspi. I draw from this fieldwork for my discussion of
                        Knapp’s cloth.

                        A note on the technological continuity of piña
                        production is important here. Before my fieldwork, I was
                        suspicious of many publications’ assumption that the
                        tools and processes of making piña remained unchanged.
                        However, as I met with artisans and observed their
                        craft, the nuances between change and continuity became
                        more evident. While there are certainly a few processes
                        that are now mechanized for greater efficiency, the
                        delicate nature of piña fiber has mostly resisted the
                        use of other tools that might damage the material. See
                        Lua, “Interrogating Translucence,” 25–26.

                        fashion, I want to acknowledge the voyeurism that might
                        be inherent in this genre of painting. Tipos del pais,
                        which are paintings that depict the different attire
                        across socioeconomic class and race, were products made
                        as souvenirs for international visitors to Manila. As
                        such, these images might not capture the nuanced and
                        lived connections between cloth, fashion, socioeconomic
                        class, and race.
