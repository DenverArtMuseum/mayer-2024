    <title>An Ocean of Blue and White | Transpacific Crossings</title>

    <meta name="description" content="For 250 years (1565–1815), the Manila Galleon transported Asian goods from the Philippines to the Americas under the rule of the Spanish Crown. Stopping in Acapulco, Mexico, the silk, fans, lacquered goods, clothes, and porcelain brought by the galleon rapidly circulated through the Americas, introducing a new visual culture that influenced objects, consumers, makers, and merchants alike. Conversely, products imported from the Americas, such as silver, indigo dye, cochineal red, chili peppers, and corn, had an enormous impact on Asia. Eleven scholars from the United States, Mexico, and Singapore present current research on how the vast exchange of materials, techniques, and ideas between continents impacted the trajectory of art and material culture across the Pacific.">

                  Acapulco is a famous vacation destination today, especially
                  for people from Mexico City. Its appeal began in the 1950s,
                  when Hollywood actors and the international jet set flocked to
                  its sunny shores. However, relatively few people outside
                  academic circles know about the Acapulco–Manila Galleon trade
                  route and the renowned Acapulco Fair, where silver from the
                  Americas traded for a wide range of luxurious and exotic goods
                  from across the ocean. Although Acapulco was a small port
                  until the second half of the twentieth century, it was a nodal
                  point in sixteenth- to early nineteenth-century global
                  commerce. First, it was the designated American port for the
                  Acapulco–Manila route (the name depending on whether the ship
                  was sailing to or from Manila or Acapulco), bridging both
                  sides of the Pacific. Second, it was also connected to the
                  ports of Panama and Callao, Peru, with merchants arriving with
                  South American silver. Mexico City was a short way from
                  Acapulco, connecting to Puebla, Veracruz, and then on to the
                  Atlantic and Caribbean.

                  Much archaeological research has been undertaken in the last
                  decade, feeding into what can be called an “archaeology of the
                  Manila Galleon.” The most significant body of work
                  aoncentrates on ceramics, including style, provenance,
                  distribution, and consumption studies. For many years,
                  archaeological evidence from different shipwrecks and
                  excavations has contributed to our understanding of
                  transpacific trade. Archaeological work has revealed
                  production centers and even specific kiln sites, as well as
                  studies of porcelain commercialization, use, and influence in
                  Mexico and Manila, among others.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                  Since 2015, archaeological excavations at Acapulco have
                  yielded an interesting collection of porcelain. This brings to
                  light new evidence about the port’s commercial activity and a
                  better understanding of the types of pieces available for
                  commercialization in New Spain and beyond. Some of the sherds
                  tell individual stories and contribute to our understanding of
                  the early modern world and the Manila Galleon.

                <p><strong>Acapulco</strong></p>
                <p>
                  Designated in 1573 as the official terminus of the
                  Acapulco–Manila Galleon route, Acapulco’s well-protected
                  harbor became the entry and exit point for galleons traveling
                  along this crucial commercial route for over 250 years. In
                  1565, the first galleon, the <em>San Pedro</em>, under the
                  direction of fray Andrés de Urdaneta, discovered the
                  <em>tornaviaje</em>, or return route, from the Philippines,
                  following the northern Pacific currents to the American
                  continent and then sailing south to reach Acapulco. This
                  development made it possible to establish a continuous
                  connection between Acapulco and Manila. Manila itself was part
                  of a preexisting network of Asian commercial routes. The
                  Spanish Crown protected this trade route from competing
                  interests, such as the merchants from Seville or Lima. Under
                  the direction of the Casa de la Contratación, the merchants of
                  Mexico controlled the trade, fighting with the irregular
                  Peruvian ships and merchants that made the voyage yearly for
                  the best products and prices. Taxation on imported products
                  helped finance the administration of the Philippines and
                  supported the Church in the islands. Historical accounts
                  mention the luxurious items that passed through Acapulco,
                  including silks, cotton, and other textiles from India, China,
                  and the Philippines; spices and precious woods from Southeast
                  Asia; lacquerware and screens from Japan; and ceramics from
                  China.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Several historical figures testify that Acapulco was an ideal
                  port, as William Lytle Schurz pointed out in his famous 1939
                  book on the Manila Galleon:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    Domingo Fernández de Navarrete, a much-traveled friar,
                    called it “the best and safest harbor in the world, as was
                    duly asserted by those who have seen many others.” Of the
                    size of the harbor Dampier remarks: “The Port of Acapulco is
                    very commodious for the reception of Ships, and so large,
                    that some hundreds may safely Ride there without damnifying
                    each other.” Lord Anson considered it “the securest and
                    finest in all the northern parts of the Pacific Ocean.”
                    Malaspina, one of the most skilled of Spanish navigators of
                    the later eighteenth century, a scientific seaman of the
                    type of Cook and Bougainville, favored the further
                    development of Acapulco as a Spanish naval base for the
                    northern Pacific and a great commercial port. He thought it
                    much superior to San Blas. “No one can deny,” he said, “that
                    Acapulco has great advantages which are found together in
                    very few ports of the globe.” Humboldt, who saw the place in
                    1803, thus describes the harbor, which he called “the finest
                    of all those on the coast of the great ocean,” and again
                    “one of the finest ports in the known world:” “The port of
                    Acapulco forms an immense basin cut in granite rocks.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Despite the galleons, the annual fair, and the arrival of
                  Peruvian ships and merchants from the interior, Acapulco
                  remained modest throughout its historical period (fig. 1). Its
                  most prominent structure was the Fort of San Diego. Other
                  notable buildings included the cathedral church, a Franciscan
                  convent, the San Juan de Dios Hospital, and the Royal
                  Contaduría. None of them were significant or strongly built.
                  In 1598, some 250 tiny houses existed, made of wood, adobe,
                  and palm. The hot climate, the mosquitos and animals, and the
                  lack of food, among other reasons, made it hellish for a
                  population to develop. Many accounts from travelers and
                  administrators attest to this.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>

                  In 1578, fear spread through New Spain as it became known that
                  Francis Drake passed northward through the viceroyalty,
                  attacking the town of Huatulco. The same happened when Thomas
                  Cavendish, in 1587, captured the galleon <em>Santa Ana</em> at
                  the tip of Baja California. However, it was the Dutch attack
                  on Acapulco in 1615 by Joris van Spilbergen that prompted the
                  viceroy, Diego Fernández de Córdoba, 1st Marquess of
                  Guadalcázar, to commission the construction of a new redoubt
                  from the engineer Adrian Boot, who oversaw the drainage works
                  in Mexico City. However, the viceroy rejected the initial
                  proposal because it was small and insufficient. Boot then sent
                  a fortification project consisting of five towers joined
                  together with projections to give a pentagonal shape, which
                  was approved. Work started in 1616, on top of a promontory
                  dominating the bay to prevent attacks by pirates and enemies
                  of the Crown who entered the bay. It was completed by February
                  1617. The fortress remained impregnable throughout the
                  colonial period, except for a brief attack by Dutch pirates in
                  1624. However, a severe earthquake on April 2, 1776, caused
                  substantial damage, leading to reconstruction efforts that
                  commenced in 1778 and concluded in 1783. The rebuilt fortress,
                  made of stone and surrounded by a moat, could accommodate up
                  to two thousand people with ample provisions for a year.
                  Initiated in 1810, the independence movement in Mexico became
                  interested in capturing Acapulco. General José María Morelos
                  sieged the Fort of San Diego for two years. The War of
                  Independence ended the route; the last ship sailed off into
                  the Pacific in 1815, ending a long, prosperous line. Acapulco
                  remained sleepy until new opportunities came in the form of
                  tourism and it regained its celebrated name.

                <p><strong>Manila Galleon Archaeology</strong></p>
                <p>
                  The archaeological interest in the colonial period of Acapulco
                  arose from broader interest in the archaeology of the Manila
                  Galleon, a theme and an approach that explores all aspects of
                  the galleons, such as infrastructure, maritime and nautical
                  aspects, trade, cultural influences, distribution, etc. and
                  which has been developing through several papers and
                  archaeological interventions over time.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                  As José Luis Gasch-Tomás has noted: “Unfortunately, the
                  archaeological studies of the Manila galleons have not
                  developed as much as their histories. Apart from a few
                  excavated underwater sites and several studies of the material
                  culture transported in the galleons, especially Chinese
                  porcelain and to a lesser extent Chinese silk and Japanese
                  furniture, experts have undertaken few archaeological
                  researches of the Manila galleons.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>
                  Among the few projects focused on shipwrecks recently
                  conducted are the search for the galleon
                  <em>San Francisco</em> in Japan by archaeologist Jun Kimura
                  and several in the Philippines by Bobby Orillaneda and his
                  team.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 2000, the Underwater Archaeology Office (SAS) of the
                  National Institute of Anthropology and History of Mexico
                  (INAH) began researching the remains of a sixteenth-century
                  Manila galleon, wrecked on the journey from the Philippines to
                  New Spain, on the coast of Baja California at the 38th
                  parallel. This desolate, desert-like region by the ocean holds
                  remains of the ship’s cargo scattered along eleven kilometers
                  of the shoreline. A reference to the shipwreck site appeared
                  in George Kuwayama’s
                  <em>Chinese Ceramics in Colonial Mexico</em> (1997).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>
                  His book presented images of Chinese porcelain sherds from an
                  “unpublished site off the Baja California coast.” This
                  citation aroused the interest of maritime historian Edward Von
                  der Porten, who contacted him for more information. Kuwayama
                  revealed that beachcombers had collected porcelain sherds from
                  the site. In 1999, with this knowledge and under the
                  supervision of INAH, Von der Porten, along with archaeologists
                  Jack Hunter and Edward Ritter, organized the first expedition
                  to the site thanks to the beachcombers’ information (fig. 2).
                  SAS-INAH subsequently established the archaeological project
                  “Manila Galleon, Baja California,” providing financial support
                  for ongoing excavations, conservation, and research until Von
                  der Porten’s passing in 2019. To date, 3,787 artifacts have
                  been documented at the site, with extensive finds from the
                  Chinese Wanli period (1573–1620), totaling 1,923 pieces. The
                  collection primarily includes underglaze blue-and-white
                  plates, bowls, cups, bottles, and boxes, alongside polychrome
                  pieces studied by Von der Porten. The porcelain was
                  manufactured in Jingdezhen (Jiangxi province) and Zhangzhou
                  (Fujian province), and it significantly resembles the pieces
                  from the sunken Chinese vessel <em>Nan’ao 1</em>, thought to
                  have been en route to Manila in the early stages of the trade
                  route.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>
                  Additionally, at least five different types of stoneware
                  sherds and complete pieces from southern China and Southeast
                  Asia (possibly northern Vietnam) have been identified and were
                  likely used as containers during the voyage. Other significant
                  finds include fragments of Spanish olive jars, cloisonné
                  plates, Mexican silver coins, a Chinese coin, small lead
                  objects, pieces of beeswax, lead shot, metal fittings, a
                  bronze incense burner cover shaped like a Fu dog, and compass
                  gimbals.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>
                  These artifacts provide crucial insights into the cargo
                  carried aboard the galleons and the ship construction
                  technology of that era.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup>

                  In 2006, an archaeological survey along the north coast of the
                  state of Guerrero indicated possible smuggling activities
                  related to the Manila Galleon route. Ming dynasty (1368–1644)
                  porcelain sherds and a type of maiolica known as Romita
                  Sgraffito were recorded. Around the same time, neutron
                  activation analysis revealed this type of slipware was made in
                  the region of the lakes of Michoacán. Therefore, the
                  hypothesis is that some smuggled porcelain was destined for
                  this region as part of an exchange route not documented in the
                  historical record, revealing that not all Asian merchandise
                  arrived in Acapulco before traveling to Mexico City as was the
                  norm. Alternative, lesser-known routes were utilized for
                  trade. The coastal area of Petatlán, to the north, was ideal
                  for ships to anchor and load water, facilitating the unloading
                  of select cargo items.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup>

                <p>
                  In 2016 and 2017, SAS-INAH conducted an archaeological
                  inspection of the Port of San Blas on the Pacific coast of
                  Mexico, which yielded a collection of Chinese porcelain sherds
                  linked to the transpacific trade (fig. 3). Although officially
                  active only for a few decades in the eighteenth century, this
                  port served as a stop along the Manila Galleon route. The
                  predominant type of porcelain in the collection is landscape
                  designs produced in Jingdezhen, which later developed into the
                  “willow pattern.” The second most common type is
                  blue-and-white Jingdezhen porcelain, followed by red overglaze
                  bowls known as Guanzai, dated from the mid-seventeenth to
                  nineteenth centuries, indicating a continued movement of Asian
                  goods even prior to San Blas’s establishment as a maritime
                  department. As Gasch-Tomás mentions, “Remains of shipwrecks
                  and Chinese porcelain are becoming as important as archival
                  documents to write the history of the Manila galleons.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup>
                  Indeed, porcelain has been archaeologically reported in the
                  past in Mexico as elsewhere by authors like Goggin, Lister and
                  Lister, López Cervantes, Pierson, and Fournier, among
                  others.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref-anchor">13</a></sup>
                  A distribution map showing archaeological finds of these
                  ceramics was published in 2019 by Fournier and Junco.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup>
                  Many noteworthy archaeological works have been published
                  since, some about specific sites like the kilns in China, new
                  wrecks found in the Philippines, and ports and cities along
                  the route. It would be another type of undertaking to be able
                  to cite them all, but allow me to highlight some notable
                  contributions, such as the work of Guanyu Wang, who
                  characterized the porcelain traded by the Manila Galleon in
                  the early part of the trade, during the Ming dynasty,
                  describing three key moments.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup>
                  In the same book, Nida Cuevas writes about Fujian and Hizen
                  wares found in the Philippines, Tai-Kang Lu addresses Kraak
                  pieces from Macau and Taiwan linked to the Manila Galleon, and
                  Etsuko Miyata describes the ceramics at Nagasaki and their
                  relation to the Galleon.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup>
                  Archaeology is in an interesting position from which to study
                  not simply the design, distribution, and evolution of
                  porcelain but also the preferences of consumers. Furthermore,
                  symbolic aspects (as mentioned in the work of Skowronek) and
                  stylistic influences on Mexican ceramics from the imported
                  Chinese porcelain appear in shape, color, and style (as in the
                  work of Castillo and Fournier).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup>
                  It also allows us to reconstruct aspects of the past, such as
                  in San Blas, where porcelain allows us to understand the
                  temporality of the site beyond historical references,
                  including smuggling routes which by nature are little
                  documented, or as in Acapulco, where the distribution of
                  porcelain permits us to make inferences on the location of the
                  fair and where the galleon was unloaded. In recent years, a
                  vibrant study of these topics has emerged and will contribute
                  significantly to understanding the Manila Galleon from a
                  material perspective.

                  Historically, archaeological research in Acapulco has
                  primarily focused on prehispanic remains around the bay. The
                  area is home to various recorded archaeological sites,
                  petroglyphs, and ceramic artifacts, some of which are among
                  the oldest ceramics in Mesoamerica.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18" class="footnote-ref-anchor">18</a></sup>
                  However, little attention had been given to the colonial
                  period, and no materials were reported until 2015. That year,
                  excavations at the Fort of San Diego uncovered enough evidence
                  to initiate a long-overdue project focused on the colonial
                  period (fig. 4). In 2015, the SAS-INAH responded to a report
                  in Acapulco Bay and documented some historical objects that
                  divers retrieved from the water. Also, excavations in Acapulco
                  commenced as a rescue effort linked to maintenance work on the
                  outer wall of the San Diego fortress, which is now the History
                  Museum of Acapulco, recovering archaeological materials from
                  the prehispanic, early contact, colonial, and republican
                  periods. This excavation found various materials such as
                  ceramics, metal, glass, stone, and bone. Among the ceramics
                  are sherds of prehispanic and local wares, Spanish olive jars,
                  Chinese porcelain, English transfer-printed pottery, and Asian
                  stoneware. Archaeological research focusing on the colonial
                  period in Acapulco has led to the developmente of a
                  comprehensive project that includes underwater and land
                  investigations at the port, the “Proyecto de Arqueología
                  Marítima del Puerto de Acapulco” (PAMPA, or Maritime
                  Archaeology Project at the Port of Acapulco), which aims to
                  reconstruct historic Acapulco’s maritime activity. One of the
                  main goals of PAMPA is to understand the relationship between
                  archaeological materials and trade dynamics over time,
                  examining how these evolved and changed. Since Acapulco was
                  the gateway between New Spain and the Pacific Ocean,
                  investigating the archaeological remains at the port is key to
                  understanding commercial dynamics of the colonial period. The
                  project also involves documenting shipwrecks and the remains
                  of vessels to catalog all historical elements found within the
                  bay. The project employs a variety of theoretical approaches,
                  including historical archaeology and maritime archaeology, to
                  interpret these findings.
                </p>

                  A second archaeological excavation took place in downtown
                  Acapulco in 2016, where the local government initiated a
                  thirty-meter ditch for a water system replacement adjacent to
                  the Cathedral on Francisco I. Madero, La Paz, and José María
                  Iglesias streets. This two-meter-deep ditch unveiled thousands
                  of blue-and-white porcelain fragments, primarily of the Kraak
                  porcelain style produced in various private kilns in
                  Jingdezhen. Given the site’s central location, it is
                  hypothesized that it may have been where the traditional
                  Acapulco Fair was hosted annually just after the arrival of
                  the Manila Galleon every December or January. The similarities
                  in motifs on the porcelain sherds and their size suggest that
                  many pieces sustained damage during the long five- to
                  six-month voyage from Asia to Acapulco, with some items likely
                  breaking en route and being discarded upon arrival.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19" class="footnote-ref-anchor">19</a></sup>
                  Three test pits on the slopes of Fort San Diego were
                  excavated. Many materials were recovered during this season,
                  including over five thousand pieces of Chinese porcelain,
                  mainly from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 2017, further archaeological rescue was conducted in the
                  town center, focusing on several streets, especially parts of
                  La Quebrada street. In 2018, excavations were carried out at
                  Fort San Diego, with four excavation units recovering material
                  and documenting an architectural element before a section of
                  the fort wall. In 2019, restoration work was performed on the
                  mentioned part of the old fort, and it was reburied. This
                  project has recovered over ten thousand colonial-period
                  artifacts, including Chinese porcelains, maiolica and colonial
                  ceramics, English earthenware, metal artifacts, and glass.

                <p>
                  In the 2020 season, activities were proposed related to the
                  organization of the information generated, as well as
                  documentary research efforts, highlighting access to digital
                  collections for the creation of a digital and physical library
                  of maps and plans of the port of Acapulco and Fort San Diego
                  from the colonial era. Additionally, dissemination talks were
                  planned for primary schools and carried out remotely. Once
                  normal post-pandemic activities resumed in 2023, office work
                  focused on analysis of the recovered porcelain collection and
                  creating a database for information and consultation. Finally,
                  in 2024, along with Dr. Ivan Valdéz of UNAM, we curated the
                  restructuring of the museography content at Fort San Diego,
                  displaying some of the pieces recovered from the excavations
                  conducted there (fig. 5).

                  While Chinese porcelain had not been previously documented
                  archaeologically in Acapulco, the more than 6,500 fragments
                  identified to date are noteworthy. Preliminary analysis
                  indicates that, within the fortress, most of the porcelain
                  dates to the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, whereas the
                  porcelain found in downtown Acapulco belongs to the sixteenth
                  and early seventeenth centuries; some of the sherds appear to
                  be from very early in the route, the 1560s and 1570s. This
                  discrepancy can be attributed to the fortress’s destruction
                  during an earthquake in 1766, followed by its reconstruction.
                  In contrast, the downtown area, where more than 90 percent of
                  all porcelain was recovered, mainly from the Wanli period
                  (1573–1620) of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), may well be the
                  site of the cargo offloading, the area for opening containers,
                  and where the Acapulco Fair was held annually. Some of the
                  pieces in the collection point to this fact. For example, over
                  a dozen fragments of a delicate plate representing deer in the
                  park from the Ming dynasty can be said to have come from the
                  same hand (fig. 6). When we overlap the fragments, we see they
                  are almost identical in the paintwork. As with a puzzle, the
                  fragments that could not be joined belong to at least four
                  plates, maybe six or more. Having been made and packed in
                  Jingdezhen, they traveled to the coast, sailed to Manila, then
                  sailed to Mexico, and arrived partially broken in Acapulco
                  (fig. 7). They were likely discarded in the same place where
                  the unpacking was done during the Acapulco Fair. A dozen
                  plates were bundled together, and a few cracked. Whatever the
                  fact, they are also important as they are the finest example
                  of a considerable number of plates with a deer-in-the-park
                  design. There is also a plate from around the same period from
                  Zhangzhou, somewhat reconstructed, and it has a lower-quality
                  design of a deer in the park in the collection (fig. 8).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup>
                  This comparison gives us a range of what the consumers in New
                  Spain acquired.

                  As with the plates mentioned earlier, around two dozen
                  fragments of large bowls with deer (ca. 1580–95) suggest items
                  discarded when unpacked (fig. 9). Although the deer are not
                  identical in all (some are), they are the same shape and
                  design with slight variations; for instance, the dotting in
                  the deer is sometimes in clusters of four and in other
                  instances is in lines. The interior base presents, in all but
                  one, a rabbit. A few small bowls also repeat the deer motif in
                  a smaller version. The same thing occurs with the typical cups
                  decorated with a crow motif (ca. 1590–1600). There are a dozen
                  bases with this motif, with slight variations of the bird in
                  the interior bottom of the cup and the exterior decoration.

                  A fascinating example of the porcelain that arrived in Mexico
                  is a sherd identified by Etsuko Miyata as the well-known scene
                  of the poem “Lanting Xu.” The famous Chinese poem narrates an
                  event that took place in 353 CE during the Jin dynasty
                  (265–420) when the poet and calligrapher Wang Xizhi (303–361)
                  gathered with fellow literati at the Orchid Pavilion to
                  celebrate the Spring Purification ritual. They collectively
                  composed thirty-seven poems, among which Wang wrote the
                  “Lanting Xu,” serving as a preface to their work.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22" class="footnote-ref-anchor">22</a></sup>
                  The poem has become one of China’s masterpieces of
                  calligraphy. Over a millennium later, this story was depicted
                  on a blue-and-white porcelain bowl produced in Jingdezhen at
                  the end of the Ming dynasty (fig. 10). Like many other goods,
                  the understandings of these objects varied among the
                  individuals who crafted them in China, those who traded them
                  in the Philippines, and those who bought them in New Spain and
                  beyond. Exploring these perspectives can provide a more
                  comprehensive understanding of the interconnected societies
                  involved.

                  Overall, the downtown segment of the collection contains early
                  blue-and-white Zhangzhou pieces, fine early Wanli, typical
                  export wares (such as the phoenix plates), and some
                  polychromed plates and bowls, which are very similar to the
                  ones found in Baja California and the <em>Nan’ao 1</em> wreck
                  (fig. 11). Fragments of Kraak saucer dishes, plates, small
                  plates, bowls, bottles, dishes, ewers, <em>klapmuts</em>,
                  cups, boxes, and jars are present.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn23" id="fnref23" class="footnote-ref-anchor">23</a></sup>
                  One sherd was identified as having been reused as a tool for
                  cutting. On the bottom of a phoenix plate, the foot and base
                  were flaked on both sides to make a cutting implement. Few
                  chocolate cups appear, a design that would become very common.
                  Few Qing dynasty (1644–1911) pieces were recovered. No
                  <em>Imari</em> or enameled pieces are present as are in Mexico
                  City, for example. The end of the Ming dynasty in the
                  seventeenth century interrupted porcelain production and flow
                  to New Spain, with the Galleon bringing fewer porcelains
                  compared to textiles, though perhaps fewer objects have been
                  found due to porcelains in different packing, unloading cargo
                  into other spaces in the port, or having larger, more stable
                  ships. These thoughts are inquiries to make sense of the
                  pattern.

                  The sherds from the fort are very different. European
                  decorations are abundant, as are some blue-and-white Canton
                  wares. A few white “Dehua” pieces, such as cups, boxes, and
                  the foot of a lion, are present. Armorial designs are but two
                  so far: One is a small fragment, likely from a plate with a
                  heraldic composition of a lion behind a red and gold flag;
                  another is the body of a chocolate cup with what appears to be
                  Ferdinand VII’s monogram (fig. 12). The design is in oxide red
                  and gold, clearly depicting the Roman numeral VII above the
                  letter F. A similar monogram appears in the commemorative coin
                  of his coronation. The extraordinary thing is that Ferdinand
                  VII became king in 1808 and had to abdicate to Napoleon’s
                  pressure shortly thereafter. After commissioning a porcelain
                  set in his honor, the chocolate cup would have arrived two or
                  three years later. He became king again in late 1813, only two
                  years before the last galleon departed Acapulco in 1815. It is
                  almost certain that these commemorative works would have
                  arrived in New Spain after Ferdinand’s abdication and would
                  have thus been discarded.

                <p>
                  The port of Acapulco, the origin and terminus of the
                  Acapulco–Manila Galleon route, has been the focus of extensive
                  archaeological work since 2015. Inspired by Manila Galleon
                  studies, this maritime archaeology project seeks to explore
                  the material aspects of this trade route. The project,
                  conducted by the Underwater Archaeology Office (SAS) of INAH,
                  has completed several field seasons and recovered a
                  significant collection of objects. In the first five field
                  seasons (2015–19), it recorded more than 6,500 sherds of
                  Chinese porcelain, Asian stoneware, olive jars, Mexican
                  majolica, and local wares, illustrating Acapulco’s trading
                  significance and daily life through ceramics. Excavations at
                  the fort have incorporated test pits and geophysical
                  explorations to locate the original fort structure that
                  collapsed in 1766 due to an earthquake. Analysis of
                  archaeological materials has provided insights into their
                  provenance and exchanges during this period. Preliminary
                  analysis of the porcelain suggests that while most of it
                  belongs to the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in the Fort
                  of San Diego, in downtown Acapulco it belongs to the sixteenth
                  and first half of the seventeenth centuries. In the case of
                  downtown, it could be the area of the cargo offloading, the
                  opening of containers, and where the Acapulco Fair took place.
                  Most of these sherds were likely pieces that arrived broken
                  from the long journey and discarded in situ. The collection of
                  Chinese porcelain excavated by PAMPA in Acapulco features a
                  variety of types imported to New Spain that makes it a unique
                  catalog of the different shapes and designs that traversed the
                  Pacific Ocean. A detailed catalog of the collection is
                  forthcoming.

                        A fragment of Wang Xizhi’s famous preface: “I am often
                        moved by the ancients’ sentimental lines, which lamented
                        the swiftness and uncertainty of life. When future
                        generations look back to my time, it will probably be
                        like how I now think of the past. What a shame!
                        Therefore, when I list out the people that were here,
                        and record their musings, even though times and
                        circumstances will change, as for the things that we
                        regret, they are the same. For the people who read this
                        in future generations, perhaps you will likewise be
                        moved by my words.”
